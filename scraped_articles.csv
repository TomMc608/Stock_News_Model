2022-02-04T11:20:30Z,Liverpool stars Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane to face off in AFCON final,"Liverpool teammates 
and Sadio Mane will come face to face in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) final after Egypt booked its place in Sunday’s game. 
    

            
 was awaiting the winner of Thursday’s semifinal between Cameroon and Egypt and, despite the host having the better chances, it was the Pharaohs who progressed on penalties. 
    

            Egyptian goalkeeper Mohamed Abou Gabal produced two brilliant saves in the shootout before Cameroon’s Clinton Njie fired his penalty wide of the post to send Egypt through after a goalless draw. 
    

            Egypt will now be bidding for a record-extending eighth AFCON title while Senegal looks to win its first. 
    

            Sunday’s final will also be the first of three matches between the two sides in the coming months with the teams pitted against each other in a two-legged playoff for a place in this year’s World Cup in Qatar. 
    

            Both Salah and Mane have spearheaded Liverpool’s success in recent seasons and they now carry the hopes of their nations on their backs. 
    

            Neither have been in lightning form during this year’s tournament but both have still scored goals, Mane netting three times and Salah twice. 
    

            

    

            Senegal last reached an AFCON final in 2019, eventually losing 1-0 to Algeria, and the current crop of players will certainly be feeling the weight of expectation to finally end the country’s wait for a title. 
    

            The current team – the top-ranked side on the continent – is full of talented players, representing clubs such as Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Liverpool and Bayern Munich.
    

            “Experience is a good asset,” Mane said. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “I think that has always been the case since the start of this tournament. We suffered so much with a lot of Covid cases and several injuries too.
    

            “We had a very difficult time, but with our experience, we kept calm until we recovered the whole group.
    

            “We played a final last time, so we have experience and we will try to win this trophy.”
    

            Egypt, meanwhile, have surprised many by making it so far in the tournament and have scraped through games without producing much exciting football. 
    

            Perhaps crucially, Egypt will be without manager Carlos Queiroz on the sideline for the final after the former Manchester United assistant was sent off for arguing with the referee in Thursday’s match. 
    

            Queiroz has been pivotal in making this Egyptian side hard to beat but will now watch from behind the scenes as the country looks to make yet more history. 
    

            It will once again look to rely on Salah who has been one of the best players in the world this season. 
    

            “We are happy, it’s true, but we have not yet reached the final objective,” Egypt’s assistant coach, Diaa Elsayed, said after the match. 
    

            “I can also add that our background is also due to the presence of one of the great players, namely Mohamed Salah. A very essential player in our team and who remains the centerpiece for us.”
    

            Salah posted videos to his Instagram story of the Egyptian players celebrating their semifinal victory on the team bus, but he will be looking to go one further to establish himself further as a serial winner."
2014-12-09T15:11:22Z,Spanish judge imposes temporary ban on Uber taxi service,"A judge in Madrid temporarily halts Uber operations in Spain
Taxi drivers' association argues that Uber is unfair competition and lacks proper licenses
It is expected to file a formal complaint before the court; Uber can then make its case

            A Spanish judge on Tuesday temporarily banned cell phone-based taxi service Uber from operating in Spain after a complaint brought by taxi drivers in the capital, Madrid.
    

            The judge issued the ban, the equivalent of a temporary injunction, on the grounds that Uber was deemed to be causing damage to the taxi industry, a court spokesman said.
    

            The hearing was in response to a complaint by the Madrid taxi association, which argued that Uber is unfair competition and also lacks the proper municipal licenses to operate a taxi service.
    

            The Madrid taxi association is expected now to file a formal lawsuit with the court, after gathering more documents and information, the court spokesman said.
    

            Legal arguments for Uber were not heard before the judge because the company is located outside of Spain, in the U.S. state of Delaware, and the taxi industry was seeking immediate relief, he said.
    

            The company is expected to have a chance to argue its points before the judge when the formal lawsuit is filed.
    

            The Madrid ruling comes on the same day that 
 after an Uber driver was accused of raping a woman in New Delhi.
    

            Transport authorities in New Delhi on Monday 
, saying their investigation revealed the company was violating permit rules.

2020-04-03T14:24:02Z,"English Premier League players ‘thrown under a PR bus’ by clubs, says Gary Lineker","Adored by millions of fans around the world, 
 suddenly find themselves in an unusual position – a lightning rod for criticism from both the public and politicians amid the coronavirus pandemic.
    

            Earlier this week, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United, Norwich City and Bournemouth announced they would be using 
–  intended to aid those employers most severely affected by the Covid-19 shutdown – to help pay the wages of non-playing members of staff placed on temporary leave.
    

            However, with the 20 Premier League clubs sharing the spoils of the current multi-billion dollar TV rights deal, many questioned why the players – who earn on average £3 million ($3.7 million) per year – weren’t helping foot the bill.
    

            “I think everybody needs to play their part in this national effort and that means Premier League footballers too,” British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said during Thursday’s daily coronavirus briefing.
    

            “Given the sacrifices people are making, including some of my colleagues in the NHS, who have made the ultimate sacrifice and gone into work and caught the disease and have sadly died, I think the first thing Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution; take a pay cut and play their part.”
    

            

    

            The Professional Footballers Association (PFA) – the players’ union in England – has been holding talks with the Premier League and the English Football League (EFL) over soccer’s response to Covid-19 and one former leading player Gary Lineker, who now works as a TV pundit, told CNN that the football stars were convenient scapegoats for politicians.
    

            “We do tend to have a go at footballers quite easily,” former England international Gary Lineker told Richard Quest. “They’re easy game. Yes, they get paid a lot of money, but I’m sure they want to help. 
    

            “They’re consistently very good in the communities and I’m sure over the coming days that footballers will stand up and be counted, either taking pay cuts or making donations to charities or staff workers that are non-playing. 
    

            “So, I’m confident that will happen, but it takes time and everyone here is jumping on the bandwagon. Politicians do tend to do that occasionally, especially at football’s expense – so, if I’m wrong, then I’ll be as critical as everybody else.”
    

            In a statement released on Friday, the Premier League said it planned to start a consultation exercise with top-flight players.
    

            “In the face of substantial and continuing losses for the 2019/20 season since the suspension of matches began, and to protect employment throughout the professional game, Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to consult their players regarding a combination of conditional reductions and deferrals amounting to 30% of total annual remuneration.
    

            “The League will be in regular contact with the PFA, and the union will join a meeting which will be held tomorrow [April 4] between the League, players and club representatives.”
    

            

    

            This week, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid players took a 70% wage cut to ensure that all non-playing members of staff continue to get paid a full salary during the pandemic, while Juventus’ first-team squad has given up 100% of its wages for four months to save the club $100 million.
    

            “I think one or two of our clubs have kind of thrown their players under a PR bus in many ways by announcing that they’re cutting staff salaries and putting them on furlough, but not affecting the players’ wages,” said Lineker.
    

            “That was not announced by the players, but it was announced by the clubs, so let’s wait and see. Let’s be a little bit patient here. Let’s not all jump on the judgment high horse and just wait and see how it pans out over the next week or so. 
    

            “I’m confident and I would be very disappointed if the players don’t do the right thing, but I’m sure they will.”
    

            

    

            The PFA called an urgent meeting on March 27 with the Premier League and the EFL to ensure the salaries of footballers in the third and fourth tiers – whose wages, it says, are “closer to the national average” – were protected for April.
    

            “Many of these players will have contracts ending in June,” the PFA said in a statement on Thursday. “These are often people with young families, for whom their immediate financial position is uncertain.”
    

            While TV money has funded handsome salaries for many players, it’s arguably also benefited the super-rich owners of the 20 Premier League clubs, whose combined wealth totals close to $85 billion, according to Forbes.
    

            Which is why the the PFA says that while it is aware of the public’s belief that players should give up their salaries to pay the wages of non-playing members of staff, it reiterated its stance that if clubs can afford to pay both, then they should continue to do so.
    

            “The players we have spoken to recognize that the non-playing staff are a vital part of their club and they do not want to see club staff furloughed unfairly,” it said. “Any use of the government’s support schemes without genuine financial need is detrimental to the wider society. 
    

            “In instances where clubs have the resources to pay all staff, the benefit of players paying non-playing staff salaries will only serve the business of the club’s shareholders.”"
2016-12-27T16:53:56Z,Welsh football team equals Ajax’s 44-year-old world record,"Welsh side has won 26 consecutive matches 
Ajax set record in 1971-72 season 
The New Saints can break it on Dec 30

            Chelsea may be grabbing all the headlines with its impressive 12-match winning streak in the English Premier League, but that’s nothing compared to a team across the border in Wales.
    

            The New Saints FC notched a 26th consecutive win in the Welsh Premier League on Monday to equal the world record by set Dutch giant Ajax during 1971-72 Eredivisie season. 
    

            The four-time European champion tweeted its congratulations to the Welsh side, which cruised to a 4-0 victory over Cefn Druids in front of a home crowd. 
    
great achievement guys! Happy Boxing Day! 👊

            “It’s been a bit of a shock that we’ve got to this stage,” club chairman Mike Harris told CNN’s World Sport show Tuesday.  
    

            “We’d recognized that we’d got to the longest run of games in our league a few weeks ago when we passed the Bangor City total, but we still thought we had a bit of a way to go.”
    

            Harris and the club were only made aware of the feat when the Guinness Book of Records got in touch before the crucial match on Boxing Day.   
    

            

    

            “That got everyone a little bit on edge, but obviously the game went in our favor so we managed to get over that last hurdle,” Harris said. 
    

            “I think the players are a great set of players and you’ve also got to give great testimony to our manager Craig Harrison, who is very professional in the way that he treats every single game, every training session and in his selection of players he’s put together over the last few years.” 
    

            Harrison’s team has emulated an Ajax side that, featuring the great Johan Cruyff, went on to complete the treble in 1972 by winning the Eredivisie, the Dutch Cup and the European Cup – the precursor to today’s Champions League. 
    

            TNS, by comparison, has never made it past the qualifying rounds of the continent’s top club competition in 10 attempts.
    

      
      

      

    

            Now 21 points clear at the top of the 12-team Welsh Premier League, the team can break the world record when it plays second-bottom Cefn Druids again on Friday. 
    

            

    

            “There’s a lot of hard work going on in the Welsh Premier League,” said Harris, whose team has won the title for the past five seasons. 
    

            “It’s a very young league compared to the more established leagues in Europe, but the clubs have worked really, really hard over the last 20 years to keep pushing forward. 
    

            

    

            “It’s nice to get some recognition for all the hard work that’s gone on over that time.”"
2018-08-03T09:25:17Z,Andy Murray withdraws from Citi Open after grueling 3 a.m. victory,"Murray says he is exhausted after two three-set encounters in two days
The former No. 1 is returning from hip injury

            An emotional Andy Murray sobbed into his towel on the side of the court after a grueling victory over world No. 93 Marius Copil in Washington – a game that finished at 3 a.m. Friday local time.
    

            Hours later, tournament organizers confirmed
 that Murray had withdrawn from Washington’s Citi Open due to fatigue and would not play in the quarterfinals. He also will not compete in the Rogers Cup next week in Toronto, they said.
    

            “I’m exhausted after playing so much over the past four days, having not competed on the hard courts for 18 months,” Murray said in a statement. “I also need to be careful and to listen to my body as I come from a long-term injury.”
    

            Murray, who continues his return from hip surgery, overcame the Romanian 6-7 6-3 7-6 in his second three-set encounter in two days, having previously defeated fellow Briton Kyle Edmund. 
    
No words, 
. 
Just thanks for your emotions... 😍🙏
 

            “Just the emotions coming at the end of an extremely long day and a long match,” Murray, 31, said of his reaction to the Copil match, after which he sat crying into his towel for several minutes. 
    

            The former world No. 1 had to dig deep after conceding a 5-0 advantage in the first-set tie break to lose 7-5, but Murray twice broke Copil in the second set to force a decider.
    

            

    

            The pair shared breaks in the third set, and as the clock ticked on later into the night, Murray eventually emerged victorious (7-4) in the final tie break – at 3:01 a.m.
    

            The three-time grand slam winner has slipped to world No. 832 during his injury rehab and is now chasing his first ATP title since March 2017. 
    

            

    

            Murray would have faced Alex de Minaur in the quarterfinals in Washington. The Australian defeated South Korea’s Hyeon Chung 6-2 4-6 6-2."
2023-02-24T09:54:29Z,Sevilla goalkeeper Marko Dmitrović punched by pitch invader during Europa League match at PSV Eindhoven,"Sevilla’s 2-0 loss to PSV Eindhoven in Thursday’s 
 match turned ugly when a pitch invader ran on the field and punched the Spanish club’s goalkeeper Marko Dmitrović at the Philips Stadium in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
    

            Towards the end of the match, which resulted in PSV being eliminated from the tournament 3-2 on aggregate, the spectator can be seen on video walking up to Dmitrović before throwing a punch at his head.
    

      
      

      

    

            The 6-foot-4-inch Serbian goalkeeper quickly pinned down the pitch invader before security personnel arrived and escorted the assailant off the field.
    

            Dmitrović, who made the start in goal after starter 
 was scratched late due to illness, stayed in the game after the incident.
    

            “He pushed me from behind and then came and got in my face and tried to hit me,” Dmitrović said of the incident. 
    

            “He grazed the side of my nose a little and then honestly, I wanted to hit him back but it’s never pretty. If he really wants to fight let’s go to an event or a sport like boxing or anything. Here, in this sport, these things aren’t deserved but alas.
    

      
      

      

    

            “There’s always fans who are drunk and crazy and an idiot who assaults. This shouldn’t happen and I hope they punish him and anyone else who assaults anyone on the pitch in the future.”
    

            Six-time champion Sevilla cruised past PSV Eindhoven 3-0 in the first leg of the playoff, leaving the Dutch side with a tall task heading into Thursday night’s match.
    

            In the second leg, Luuk de Jong netted a goal in the 77th minute for PSV Eindhoven. 
    

            After the Dmitrović incident, substitute Fabio Silva doubled PSV’s lead five minutes into stoppage time but it was too little, too late as the full-time whistle would be blown shortly after.
    

            Despite the second-leg loss, Sevilla advances to the Round of 16."

Three-time Tour de France winner says bike is ""totaled""
Froome was training near his home in Monaco

            Three-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome has been knocked off his bike in a hit-and-run incident while training near Monaco.
    

            The British cyclist, who won the Tour in 2013, 2015 and 2016, tweeted a picture of his crumpled bike on Tuesday but confirmed he hadn’t been injured.
    

            He said: “Just got rammed on purpose by an impatient driver who followed me onto the pavement! Thankfully I’m okay. Bike totaled. Driver kept going!”
    
Just got rammed on purpose by an impatient driver who followed me onto the pavement! Thankfully I'm okay 🙏 Bike totaled. Driver kept going! 

            The Briton was riding in Beausoleil, close to his home in Monaco, when the incident took place. He is currently in training ahead of the Critérium du Dauphiné, an eight-day race in southern France that starts on June 4.
    

            

    

            

    

            The Critérium du Dauphiné forms part of the Kenyan-born cyclist’s preparations for his attempt to win a hat-trick of Tour de France titles, when the world’s most prestigious road race returns for its 104th edition.
    

            Italian cyclist and 2011 Giro d’Italia winner Michele Scarponi was killed in April when he was hit by a van when out on a training ride near his home in Filottrano, on the east coast.
    

            “This is a tragedy too big to be written,” his team Astana said in a statement about Scarponi, who had two young children with his wife Anna.
    

      
      

      

    

            Froome is a divisive figure in France.
    

            With the 
 still hanging over the Tour, Froome has been repeatedly accused of doping even though he insists he has always raced clean.
    

            He has been shouted at and spat on during the race, with one fan even throwing a cup of urine over him during the 2015 installment and calling him a doper.
    

            In an eventful race last year, Froome was fined for lashing out at a spectator who ran too close to him and decided to briefly jog up the famous Mont Ventoux after a crash wiped out his bike.
    

            The 31-year-old Froome says he sees himself as a spokesman for clean cycling and insists the recent controversy surrounding Team Sky will not affect his legacy.
    

            His team has been rocked by a UK Anti-Doping inquiry after revelations that a mystery package was delivered to Bradley Wiggins at an event shortly before his 2011 Tour win.
    

            Team Sky boss Dave Brailsford appeared before a Parliament select committee to reveal the decongestant Fluimucil was in the package bound for Wiggins. 
    

            Questions have also been asked about how Team Sky used therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), which are essentially doctor’s notes enabling athletes to use medicines that would otherwise be banned.
    

            Wiggins has come under particular scrutiny over his use of TUEs for the banned anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone as well as that package that was delivered by British Cycling coach Simon Cope during the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine tour.
    

            Wiggins has yet to publicly comment on the UKAD inquiry though in March he told Sky Sports’ Soccer AM show: “Fortunately there’s an investigation and I obviously can’t say too much because that will run its course and then I’ll have my say.
    

            “There’s a lot to say and it’s going to shock a few people.” 
    

            

    

            Team Sky have constantly maintained that while they may have handled the situation badly, nothing untoward took place."
2019-09-20T05:26:55Z,Nine years of austerity have stripped thousands of disabled Brits of support they need to survive,"Sarifa Patel’s 500-foot trip to her nearest bus stop takes half an hour. Walking is painful and she needs several breaks. Patel, who lives in east London, has a wheelchair, but since undergoing surgery a few years ago she no longer has the strength to push herself.
    

            The 60-year-old doesn’t want to give up her part-time job at a charity, so requested a mobility scooter through a government scheme aimed at helping disabled people access employment. She has been waiting for three years.
    

            A decade of austerity policies and deep cuts to social services and 
 in the United Kingdom has made it difficult for people like Patel to access the care they need. A 2018 report by a UN human rights expert said government policy has “
 … on people with disabilities who are already marginalized.”
    

            The future is also uncertain. New UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged more money for the cash-strapped National Health Service. Johnson’s hardline approach to Brexit, however, increases the likelihood of the country leaving the European Union without a deal, with potentially damaging economic consequences 
    

            According to forecasts by the 
 and the 
, a no-deal Brexit would likely push the UK into a deep recession and put public spending under pressure. It was the last recession, sparked by the global financial crisis in 2008, that led to the austerity measures that the UN says have decimated Britain’s social services.

    

            For Patel, the situation is difficult now. She 
, a long-term condition that causes pain, muscle spasms and stiffness. Sometimes it is so bad she can’t walk at all. 
    

            “I’ve been really struggling with my knees, but they’ve not listened to me,” she says of her scooter request.
    

            The UK government’s Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), which is responsible for disability benefits, would not comment on Patel’s individual case.
    

      
      

      

    

            If Patel really needs to go somewhere, her only option is to take a cab. Patel spends roughly £200 ($242) a month on taxis. It’s money she says she wouldn’t have to spend if she wasn’t disabled.
    

            That’s a common story. Scope, a UK disability charity, said the average “disability price tag” comes to £583 ($706) a month. 
    

            “That’s the amount disabled people have to spend on things that non-disabled people don’t need,” James Taylor, Scope’s head of policy, told CNN.
    

            This figure includes buying and repairing special equipment, as well as spending money on everyday goods and services that disabled people have to use a lot more often, Taylor said. 
    

            The extra cost has grown in recent years. Following the global economic crisis, successive UK governments attempted to save money by reforming Britain’s welfare system. 
    

            These changes were meant to make the system leaner and more streamlined, replacing “outdated” benefits with new ones. But the reform proved difficult for many people living with disabilities.
    

            “It was designed as more cost-effective and less generous,” Taylor said. 
    

            “We are finding people who were getting the previous benefit are no longer able to get the new one, so there is a group of disabled people who have been hit very hard,” he added.
    

            Latest available DWP 
 show that as of last October, 47% of people who were receiving the old disability benefit, known as Disability Living Allowance, had their payments reduced or scrapped altogether after transferring to the new system, called Personal Independence Payment.
    

            That is intentional: the government expected the reform would mean around 
.
    

      
      

      

    

            It said that the point was to make the system more sustainable and focused on those with the greatest needs.
    

            A DWP spokesperson said the new system is better because it is “taking a much wider look at the way a person’s health condition or disability impacts them on a daily basis.” 
    

            But Scope said some disabled people have lost £300 to £400 a month because of the changes. “That has a huge impact on what they’re able to afford, and the quality of life that they have,” Taylor said. 
    

            Most people switching to the new system have to go through an official assessment to determine the level of care and mobility assistance they need. 
    

            The requirements became stricter under the new system. For example, it used to be that anyone unable to walk 50 meters (164 feet) without aid would qualify for higher mobility support payments.
    

            Under the new system, only people who can’t 
. That means that those who can walk over 20 meters but not 50 have suddenly had their payments slashed, even though their condition has not changed.
    

            A DWP spokesperson said the rule was not set in stone and that even people who can walk more than 20 meters can still get the higher rate if they “cannot do so safely, to an acceptable standard, repeatedly or in a reasonable time period.”
    

            Patel was “downgraded” in 2016. She slumped from “higher” to “standard” support rates, resulting in more than £60 cut to her weekly payments. 
    

            “And then when I spoke to the wheelchair services people, they said I should be able to buy a scooter from the mobility benefit,” Patel said. She said a scooter or electric chair 
. Even if she was able to put money aside, it would take her years to save up enough to buy one. 
    

            She has tried to have the decision to lower her payments overturned and got a new assessment from a different doctor. She is now waiting for a tribunal.
    

      
      

      

    

            The tribunal odds are on Patel’s side. According to the Ministry of Justice, 
 against disability payments decisions are successful.
But the appeal process is time consuming, taking on average almost a year. In the meantime, the person appealing is stuck without funds. 
    

            “It inflicts hardship on people, because in many cases, most or a large portion of their income is withdrawn,” said Sara Reis, research and policy officer at the UK Women’s Budget Group, a research organization. 
    

            “And there will be many people who won’t go through the appeal process because it’s an onerous thing and it can be daunting, intimidating to stand before a tribunal and state your case,” she added.
    

            While she awaits that decision, Patel hopes that when her next big muscle spasm comes, she won’t be out and about. Freezing up in the street makes her feel vulnerable. 
    

            “I get really frustrated and angry because I can be walking… and the next minute, my muscle spasms up in my leg, and it becomes like a pencil… it’s frightening.”"
2023-09-23T06:08:25Z,"Never ‘insult Poles again,’ Poland’s prime minister tells Ukraine’s Zelensky","Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has told Volodymyr Zelensky never to “insult Poles again” after the 
 president suggested his neighbor was putting on a show over their disputes on grain exports.
    

            The Polish leader fired back at Zelensky after the Ukrainian leader offered a veiled criticism of Poland at the United Nations’ general assembly this week, saying the dispute was “political theater” and that “some of our friends in Europe” have “made a thriller from the grain.”
    

            On Friday, at a rally in Swidnik, Poland, Morawiecki hit back.
    

            “I want to tell President Zelensky never to insult Poles again, as he did recently during his speech at the UN,” he said.
    

            “The Polish people will never allow this to happen, and defending the good name of Poland is not only my duty and honor, but also the most important task of the Polish government,” the Polish prime minister added.
    

      
      

      

    

            The comments by Morawiecki risk deepening the divisions between two countries that have previously been close allies united against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
    

            Tensions between them have been rising in recent weeks over a ban on Ukrainian grain, initially put in place earlier this year by several EU nations to protect the livelihood of local farmers worried about being undercut by the low price of Ukrainian grain.
    

            The EU announced plans to suspend the ban last week but 
 – alongside Hungary and Slovakia – said it would stick with it, sparking protests from Ukraine, which filed lawsuits against the three countries, and, subsequently, Zelensky’s comments at the UN.
    

            Poland immediately condemned Zelensky’s comments at the UN and its foreign ministry summoned the Ukrainian ambassador to convey its “strong protest.” Hours later, the Polish prime minister said in a blunt social media statement that the country would “no longer transfer weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland.”
    

            That had seemed to indicate a major change in policy: until now, Poland has been one of the most forthright countries in the race to get weapons and resources into Ukrainian hands.
    

            But Polish President Andrzej Duda on Thursday moved to walk back his prime minister’s comments, saying they were “interpreted in the worst possible way.”
    

            He said Morawiecki had merely been referring to new weapons being purchased for the Polish army, and that older weapons systems Warsaw deems not necessary for modernizing its own military could still be shipped across the border.
    

            NATO and European sources 
 that the Polish stance may be an attempt to woo farmers with elections due next month. 
    

            Poland has long been one of Ukraine’s staunchest allies, alongside multiple former Eastern bloc nations which fear they could be next if Russian President Vladimir Putin’s expansionist war is successful.
    

            In another sign of disenchantment over Ukraine in Eastern Europe, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has said new sanctions against Russia are not needed because they “cause more harm to Europe than Russia.”
    

            Szijjarto made the comments in an interview with Russian state media TASS on Friday following his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. 
    

            “If we look at the sanctions from a pragmatic point of view, we see that they cause more harm to Europe than to Russia,” he said, according to TASS, adding that “the new packages of sanctions are not necessary.” 
    

            Szijjarto also said that supplies of Ukrainian grain to Central European countries will destroy their agricultural sector. 
    

            “If Ukrainian grain starts to spread into Central European countries, it will definitely destroy the agricultural markets of Central Europe. Not to mention our farmers, whom we obviously need to protect,” Szijjarto continued, as cited by TASS."
2017-06-22T10:04:55Z,Step inside the kitchen of an F1 masterchef,"Michael Caines fueling F1 drivers
Award-winning chef works for Williams F1

            When Michael Caines lost his right arm in a car accident in 1994, the dream of becoming a top-level chef seemed a million miles away.
    

            Twenty-three years and two Michelin stars later, he hasn’t just become one of his industry’s most distinguished figures, he’s also fueling some of the fastest drivers in the world.
    

            A partner and ambassador for Formula One team Williams Martini Racing, the 48-year-old hosts the team’s sponsors, engineers and drivers on race weekends. 
    

            “I grew up watching Williams dominate in that era of Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill being made World Champions for this great racing team,” says Caines, who has built an empire of 
 in the United Kingdom.
    

            “You see your heroes on TV and think ‘wow!’ … and the next thing you know, you find yourself in the paddock. 
    

            “It is one of those pinch-yourself moments”
    

            F1 has a relentless race calendar which runs from March to November and stops in 20 major cities. But from Australia to Abu Dhabi, the Brit shows it’s possible to produce top-quality cuisine on the move. 
    

            “They say an army marches on its stomach and Williams is no exception,” Caines tells CNN The Circuit. 
    

            “We’ve got to produce nutritious and healthy food for the drivers, but we’ve also got to provide for the sponsors over the F1 weekend.” 
    

            His team designed a purpose-built motorhome four years ago to deliver a bespoke product for the Williams team and its numerous guests.  
    

            It can be quickly assembled at any location on the F1 circuit to deliver the optimum culinary experience, with a ground floor brasserie and first floor Michael Caines Tasting Experience.
    

            It might not be perfect, but as the chef puts it: “We get pretty close to what I do in my restaurants here on the track!”

            Caines stresses the importance of a good diet for drivers, especially since this year’s new rulings have made the sport even more physically demanding. 
    

            Even if Williams drivers Felipe Massa and Lance Stroll probably won’t be troubling the top of the drivers’ standings at the end of this season, there’s little doubt the British team is well catered for especially, says Caines, when compared with what their rivals offer. 
    

            “There’s no competition!” laughs Caines. “We out-qualify all of them!”
    

            “Toto Wolff will tell you. The first thing he said when he went to Mercedes was ‘we want our hospitality to be just like Williams’.”
    

            

    

            Not that Massa and Stroll are devouring
 before races. 
    

            Because drivers are out on the road so much, the most important ingredient is a taste of home.
    

            Both eat at a particular time on race weekends – “written in as part of the day” – and tend to not change their diet. 
    

            Stroll, an F1 debutant of Canadian descent, typically eats quinoa and high protein fish, like salmon or cod. 
    

            Massa, the first Brazilian since Ayrton Senna to win his home Grand Prix, rarely deviates from a dish of roast chicken, wild rice and tomato salad.
    

            “Everyone has to be made to feel welcome,” says Caines. “When they’re not having to worry about racing, they’ll also indulge off the menu!”
    

            

    

            The chef admits sponsors are “so key to survival” for today’s F1 teams.
    

            It’s a fact Williams has embraced, going through 2,000 bottles of Prosecco over the course of the 2016 season.
    

            “If results aren’t always what they should be on the track, at least through hospitality you can give the sponsors a great experience throughout the race weekend,” says Caines. 
    

            “I’m always thinking about how we can bring in different themes to different grands prix, whether that’s the cocktails or the food. 
    

            “We always try to influence that with the wine choices as well – English wines going alongside some of the dishes too.”
    

            The opportunity to experiment is offset by the difficulty obtaining ingredients in some race locations. 
    

            He praises the produce on offer in Monaco, lauding “the fantastic larder of fantastic seafood and salads,” but adds it can be slightly more challenging cooking in the likes of Russia and Hungary. 
    

            Still, with opportunity to watch races in between his cooking, Caines is in no doubt as to just how lucky he is. 
    

            “I derive a lot of satisfaction from the fact that something I loved as a kid is something I’m now in touch with,” he smiles. 
    

            

    

            “It’s a team sport and it goes without saying that everyone involved with Williams is here to support the team to go on, race and hopefully win.”"
2020-10-22T13:25:27Z,Baby gorilla hand-reared by zookeepers after mother struggles to look after him,"Zookeepers in the British city of Bristol
are giving a baby 
 round-the-clock care, including bottle feeding through the night, as his mother has been struggling to look after him.
    

            The team of keepers at Bristol Zoo Gardens said
that the baby, now two months old but still unnamed, was not getting enough milk from his mother, Kala, to survive and would now be hand-reared for the next four months.
    

            “Hand-rearing any animal is not a decision we take lightly as our preference is always for an animal to be reared naturally by its own mother,” Lynsey Bugg, mammals curator at the zoo, said in a statement. 
    

            “Sadly, this doesn’t always happen and in this instance we decided that it was in the baby gorilla’s best interests for us to hand rear him to ensure he had the best chance of survival.” 
    

            Kala, the baby’s mother, is said to be adjusting well and is in good health. 
    

            Bugg said that when the infant is away from his mother at night in onsite accommodation, zookeepers will try to treat him like his gorilla mother would, expecting him to hold on tight to them and making gorilla vocalizations.
    

            During the day, the infant will be in the zoo’s Gorilla House. It is hoped that if the animals are able to see, smell, touch, and be near him, the infant will soon be able to bond with the group and be accepted as a part of the family, the statement said.
    

            Zookeepers are keeping the baby gorilla out of public view for now, but visitors can view the rest of the group.
    

            The zoo invited members of the public to help choose a name 
. The options are: Motuku, meaning “Chief of the Village” in Bubi, a local language in Equatorial Guinea; Hasani, meaning “handsome” in Swahili; Luango, a town on the coast of Equatorial Guinea; or Kidosi, popular Central African name."
2020-06-18T17:10:37Z,German prosecutor accuses Russia of ordering murder in Berlin park,"Germany’s top prosecutor has accused 
 of ordering the murder of a Georgian man in a Berlin park, as they announced that a suspected contract killer has been charged over the killing. 
    

            The victim was a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of 
 descent named by German officials as Tornike K. He was shot dead by a man on a bicycle in downtown Berlin’s Kleiner Tiergarten park on August 23, 2019. Previously named as 
, the former Chechen fighter had been on his way to midday prayers.
    

            A Russian national was arrested within hours over the killing, setting off a murder mystery that has gripped Germany.
    

            While the Kremlin has denied any connection between the murder and the Russian state, the shooting triggered an investigation which also raised uncomfortable questions about the relationship between the two countries.
    

      
      

      

    

            Germany’s federal prosecutor took over the investigation in December. On Thursday, almost ten months after the murder, they said they had gathered sufficient evidence and brought charges against the suspect.
    

            “At an unknown date before July 18, 2019, the accused received the order from authorities at the central government of the Russian Federation to liquidate the Georgian national of Chechen origin,” the prosecutor’s statement reads.
    

            The suspect, named as Vladim K., is accused of the murder and of illegal possession of a weapon, the statement added.
    

            “The indictment by the federal prosecutor contains serious accusations regarding the involvement of Russian state authorities in the so-called Tiergarten murder case,” a German government spokesperson said Thursday, adding: “The Federal Government takes this very seriously.”
    

            The spokesperson said the German government would “carefully monitor” the rest of the trial until a verdict was reached, adding that two members of the Russian embassy were expelled in December in connection to the case, and that recently Germany had taken steps against Russia in connection with the hacking attack on the German Bundestag in 2015. 
    

            “The German government reserves the right to take further steps,” the statement concluded.

2020-02-16T05:23:12Z,Victims thought they were paying millions to free hostages. But the ‘minister’ who asked them was a fraudster in a mask,"There was a sense of urgency in the voice of the man claiming to be 
 defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian.
    

             “We’re talking about the lives of 
 citizens and we would like to free them. If we don’t, we expect the worst,” the man said in an audio recording of a telephone solicitation obtained by CNN. 
    

            “I need to know if you can join us in this mission so we can carry it out and if the answer is ‘yes’ then I will alert the presidency to say we have someone who can act as a mediator for us.” 
    

            On the receiving end of the telephone line was Olivier de Boisset, a Frenchman who heads an IT company in Niger.
    

            De Boisset was being asked to wire over 2 million dollars to allegedly help free French hostages being held by terrorists in Mali.
    

            The voice said France needed de Boisset’s help transferring funds because officially the country does not pay ransoms and gave assurances that France’s central bank would reimburse him.
    

            De Boisset was suspicious, but he could never have imagined the extent of the scam that was being played on him.
    

            Not only were there no French hostages in Mali, but he had just become the latest victim in a multi-million dollar con that would span two years and target more than 150 people including the spiritual leader Aga Khan, the President of Niger, the Prime Minister of Norway, the Archbishop of Lyon, the owner of Chateau Margaux wines, the King of Belgium, the director general of UNESCO and numerous CEOs.
    

            Attempts to extort money from embassies and governments were made in more than 50 countries, according to French court documents.
    

            CNN has obtained exclusive recordings made by often-skeptical victims showing how a group of fraudsters tried to pull off what some in France are calling the scam of the century by impersonating France’s then defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, and conning wealthy individuals out of 80 million euros purportedly to help pay ransoms to free French hostages being held by Islamist terrorists.
    

            Some of the money has not been recovered.
    

            Six of the alleged fraudsters are currently on trial in Paris in connection with the Le Drian hoax and a plot to impersonate Prince Albert II of Monaco while a seventh defendant is on trial only for the Albert of Monaco plot. 
    

            According to many of the victims, to earn their trust an initial phone call was followed up by a Skype video call. During this exchange, the con artist wore a custom-made silicone mask of Le Drian’s face and sat in a replica of the minister’s office complete with both the tricolor flag of France and a flag of Europe, pictures in the court documents show.
    

            Another one of those targeted in June 2016 by the bogus Le Drian was Bruno Paillard, who heads a champagne house in Reims, northern France.
    

            Paillard told CNN the hustle was impressive because of its elaborate nature. “The image was not very precise and the voice was a little bit strange. The excuse was that they were in a bunker in the ministry,” Paillard said.
    

            In addition to the Skype calls, Paillard said they communicated with him on official-looking letterheads from the ministry, but despite all their efforts Paillard said he wasn’t convinced and went straight to the police. 
    

            “As a champagne producer we make people happy, but we’re not necessarily good at saving the lives of people who are being held in strange countries,” Paillard told CNN.
    

            Paillard said the fake Le Drian had done his homework, he even knew how many children he had.
    

            Wine maker Guy-Petrus Lignac was equally astonished at how much the fraudsters knew about him. He said they drew on his background to appeal to his sense of patriotism.  
    

      
      

      

    

            “They knew so many things about me! That I had been a police officer in the past. That’s not common knowledge, it’s not on the internet. I was surprised,” Lignac told CNN. 
    

            Many of the victims were skeptical and went to the defense ministry to report the calls. The ministry alerted investigators in the summer of 2015 and an investigation was opened in April 2016, according to court documents.
    

            Lawyers for Le Drian said French embassies all over the world were warned of the scam in 2016. However, the ministry didn’t see the need for a press conference. 
    

            Turkish businessman Inan Kirac, was duped in November 2016 and over the course of one month handed over $47 million in nine transfers to bank accounts in China – the largest sum to be wired to the fraudsters by one individual.
    

            Kirac eventually realized he was being scammed and began taping the conversations.
    

            In an audio recording obtained by CNN Kirac is heard speaking with a man impersonating an aide to Le Drian.
    

            “Mr. Kirac, first of all, I wanted to express my condolences concerning the attack in Istanbul and I learned that two of your very close friends were injured in this attack,” the voice on the crackly line is heard saying.
    

            “I hope that 2016 will be a good year to defeat crime and the terrorists who deserve to go to hell,” the man said.
    

            Kirac believed his money was being used to free two French journalists who were allegedly being held hostage in Syria.
    

            Delphine Meillet, the lawyer representing the actual Le Drian, who is now France’s foreign minister, told CNN the fraudsters used the war in Syria to their advantage. 
    

            “There were real hostages at the time, in 2015, and the technique to convince them was to play on fears of terrorism,” Meillet said.
    

            “When the state asks you to do it a favor, to help fight terrorism, how can you say no? How can you say no to a minister?” she added.
    

      
      

      

    

            The voice of the fake Le Drian is allegedly that of Gilbert Chikli, according to prosecutors, a Franco-Israeli accused of being the mastermind behind the sting. He is charged with organized fraud and usurping a person’s identity. Chikli denies the charges.
    

            Meillet describes the 54-year-old as being a modern-day Victor Lustig, the notorious con man who sold the Eiffel Tower to a scrap-metal dealer in 1925, not once but twice.
    

            Chikli has a checkered past. In 2015, he was sentenced in absentia to seven years in prison for a brazen scam where he posed as prominent French CEOs in order to extort millions of euros from companies. The hoax was later the subject of a movie “Thank You for Calling” that paid Chikli as a consultant, according to court documents. 
    

            In 2017 the Parisian was arrested in Ukraine and according to court documents evidence was found on Chikli’s cell phone showing that Google searches for “silicone mask Kiev” and “Prince of Monaco” had been made.”
    

            Another defendant in the trial, Anthony Lasarevitsch, was arrested in Kiev alongside Chikli. Investigators found pictures of a silicone mask of Prince Albert II of Monaco on his cell phone.
    

            Lasarevitsch faces the same charges as Chikli, and denies any wrongdoing. His lawyer said in court that Lasarevitsch had been “dragged into the case by the media” after his arrest alongside Chikli “was broadcast to the masses.”
    

            A clip of Chikli, while incarcerated in Kiev, surfaced on social media in 2017 showing him having a fridge delivered to the prison. In the video Chikli says “this is what I’ve bought, a fridge, so I can eat some entrecote. We are the bosses!”
    

            Chikli was eventually extradited to France. He is currently in prison serving time for the CEO hoax. He’s admitted taking part in the CEO scam but says he’s not the mastermind.
    

            On Monday experts testified that the voice of the fake Le Drian bore a striking resemblance to that of Chikli.
    

            Chikli defended himself vehemently in court Monday.
    

            “What can I tell you? They’ve got it wrong!” he shouted.  
    

            “There are 20 billion cases like this per year, I’ve got nothing to do with this! I have no answers to your questions,” Chikli growled.
    

            His lawyer, Stephane Sebag, told CNN that the whole of the prosecution was based on weak analysis of the voice samples from Chikli’s interviews and that the recordings of the scam “are very poor.”
    

            “This is not enough to convince anyone of his guilt,” Sebag said.
    

            If convicted Chikli faces up to 14 years in prison and a 2 million euro fine. A verdict is expected on March 11.
    

            The real Le Drian reacted to the scam last year. “You can’t impersonate me, if you do then you go to prison,” he said.
    

            “They were pretty convincing and sadly there were victims. They did a good job of imitating my voice,” Le Drian added.

2020-08-31T11:57:44Z,Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal among critics of Novak Djokovic’s new players’ association,"has been left divided following the launch of a breakaway players’ association, with 
and Rafael Nadal among those to criticize its formation. 
    

            The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) was unveiled on Sunday as a body separate to the ATP Tour and tennis’ first player-only council since 1972. 
    

            It is being spearheaded by world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and 94th-ranked Vasek Pospisil, who said it is “very difficult, if not impossible, to have any significant impact on any major decisions” within the current structure alongside the ATP. 
    

            Djokovic, who continued his unbeaten streak in 2020 as he won the Western & Southern Open in New York, also said the current setup is “quite complex.”
    

            He told reporters after his victory over 
: “This is not a new idea. This hasn’t been something that came out of the blue. This has been a project for many players and many different generations over the last 20-plus years.
    

            “I certainly think it’s the right step forward for the players, because I think it unifies the players. It allows them to have a platform, to have an association through which they will be able to express themselves better where they will be able to talk about the ideas, the interests, and the things that are related to the players.”
    

            He added that he believes the PTPA can coexist alongside the ATP Tour, but in a statement the governing body of men’s tennis underlined the need for unity within the sport.
    

            

    

            “The governance structure of the ATP Tour provides players with equal seats at the table on every major decision affecting the circuit. We recognize the challenges that our members face in today’s circumstances,” the statement read.
    

            “However we strongly believe that now is a time for unity, rather than internal division. We remain unwavering in our commitment to deliver for our players across all areas of our business, ensuring they receive maximum benefit from their years on Tour, and that their voices are heard.
    

            “In parallel, we remain committed to working closely with the other governing bodies of tennis as we look to fulfill the true potential of our sport. Only as a unified sport can we truly focus on the fan experience, engage new audiences, and ensure that tennis continues to thrive.”
    

            Federer and Nadal, the most decorated players in the men’s game, spoke out against the PTPA.
    

      
      

      

    

            “The world is living a difficult and complicated situation. I personally believe these are times to be calm and work all of us together in the same direction. It is time for unity, not for separation,” Nadal said on social media.
    

            “These are moments where big things can be achieved as long as the world of tennis is united. We all, players, tournaments and governing bodies, have to work together. We have a bigger problem and separation and disunion is definitely not the solution.”
    

            

    

            Federer, who earlier this year called for tennis to merge its men’s and women’s governing bodies, agreed that it is time “to stand united as players, and as a sport,” while three-time grand slam champion Andy Murray questioned the absence of female players in the new association.
    

            Pospisil said there is “active dialogue with the women’s side” to incorporate female players in the PTPA. 
    

            The launch of the association comes on the eve of the 
, which gets underway in Flushing Meadows on Monday.
    

            A number of top players will not play in the tournament amid the coronavirus pandemic, including Federer and Nadal on the men’s side and top-ranked Ashleigh Barty and Simona Halep on the women’s. 
    

            Djokovic and Murray, who continues his return from a career-threatening hip injury, will compete in the men’s draw, while Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams are among the high-profile participants in the women’s singles. 
    

            As in the NBA and the Champions League, players will live in bubbles around New York, either in tournament-sanctioned hotels or private accommodation."
2023-06-06T11:08:52Z,Tennis star Miyu Kato in tears as she struggles to answer questions about controversial disqualification,"A day after being controversially 
 from the 
 for inadvertently hitting a ball girl with a ball, an emotional 
struggled to answer questions about the incident. 
    

            Kato and her partner Aldila Sutjiadi were defaulted from the doubles event on Sunday after the Japanese player struck a ball girl having innocuously hit the ball to the back of the court following a point.
    

      
      

      

    

            Kato, who was seen crying on court after her disqualification, was back in action on Monday and reached the mixed doubles semifinals after winning in straight sets alongside German partner Tim Puetz. 
    

            It’s widely reported that Kato was in tears on court after winning the quarterfinal and was visibly emotional in the press conference afterward, leaving the room momentarily to compose herself before a question was answered. 
    

            “I think, first and foremost, we’re all, including Miyu, happy that the ball girl is okay because obviously she got hit,” Puetz told reporters after coming back into the room with Kato. 
    

            “Miyu feels terrible about what happened. This was just very unfortunate for everyone, especially for her and the girl.” 
    

            A tearful Kato gave a very short answer in Japanese, saying it was difficult for her to speak English at this time. 
    

            While Puetz understood why officials made the decision, he said there was clearly no intent to hurt the ball girl. 
    

            “I understand she hit the ball girl. It was not intentional. I don’t think it was in anger,” he added.
    

            “I think everybody saw the pictures. It wasn’t anything malicious that she did. Nevertheless, it hit the ball girl.
    

            “Then two supervisors have to come on court, possibly didn’t even see it. All they see is a crying ball girl who got hit with a ball. 
    

            “In that moment, to make that decision, is very difficult.”
    

            On Monday, Kato tweeted an apology to the ball girl, her doubles partner and her supporters, saying the incident was

    

            “I want to thank everyone for your continued support. I have received a worldwide outpouring of positive energy, and it has raised my spirits tremendously,” she 
, in a post which garnered support from other players. 
    

            “Now I’m onto the mixed doubles semifinals, where I will use every bit of that positive energy to succeed!” 
    

            According to the grand slam rule book, players “shall not violently, dangerously or with anger hit, kick or throw a tennis ball within the precincts of the tournament site except in the reasonable pursuit of a point during a match (including warm-up)”
    

            The rule book states: “In all cases of default, the decision of the referee in consultation with the grand slam chief of supervisors shall be final and unappealable.”
    

            A player who is defaulted loses all ranking points earned at the tournament, the rule book states, and all prize money earned at the tournament."
2019-08-06T10:35:14Z,Schalke chairman Clemens Tönnies faces calls to quit after making racist comments,"The chairman of a leading German football club is under growing pressure to resign after making racist comments about African people during a speech last week.
    

            Schalke chairman Clemens Tönnies criticized tax increases to fight climate change while speaking at a
festival in the western city of Paderborn, suggesting instead that money be used to fund power plants in Africa.
    

            “Then the Africans would stop cutting down trees and stop producing children when it’s dark,” Tönnies was quoted as saying by regional German 

    

            He has since apologized for his remarks and said he supports Schalke’s values against “racism, discrimination and exclusion.”
    

            The club told CNN that their ethics body will be discussing his remarks soon, in an upcoming meeting.  
    

            “I would like to explicitly apologize to you, the fans, members and friends of FC Schalke 04,” Tönnies said in 
on the club’s website. “It was wrong, thoughtless … and in no way met our mission statement. I am very sorry.” 
    

      
      

      

    

            But politicians and some fans of the Bundesliga club have urged him to quit, and the German Football Association (DFB) is under pressure to discipline the businessman.
    

            Germany’s Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht has led calls for Tönnies’ comments to be punished. “Racism must be loudly and clearly contradicted,” she told newspapers of the Funke media group. 
    

            “Nowhere is integration as successful and quick to work as in sport – that must not be put at risk,” Lambrecht added.
    

            SDP lawmaker Markus Töns 
: “The racist statement by Clemens Tönnies at the “Day of Crafting” in Paderborn is incompatible with the mission statement of Schalke 04.”
    

            And Dagmar Freitag, who chairs the sports committee in Germany’s parliament, argued that Tönnies’ apology cannot make up for the damage his remarks caused.
    

            “That something like this (is) articulated by someone who holds a prominent position in the sport makes things even worse,” she told German newspaper Welt, adding that his explanation “certainly can not make up for the socio-political damage.” 
    

            CNN has asked the DFB for comment.
    

            Schalke start their Bundesliga season on August 17. Last season, they finished 14th in Germany’s top division."
2012-01-18T23:08:50Z,Abidal pounces late as Barcelona edge ‘El Clasico’ over Real Madrid,"Barcelona beat Real Madrid 2-1 in their Spanish Cup quarterfinal first leg tie
French defender strikes 13 minutes from time as holders suffer defeat at home stadium
Cristiano Ronaldo had given Real the lead before Carles Puyol equalized
Milan beat Novara to progress into the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup

            A late goal from Eric Abidal gave Barcelona a 2-1 comeback victory in the first leg of their Spanish Cup quarterfinal clash with arch rivals Real Madrid.
    

            The French defender scored the decisive goal in the match known as ‘El Clasico’ at Real’s Bernabeu stadium after Barcelona captain Carles Puyol had canceled out Cristiano Ronaldo’s opener.
    

            It means Barcelona are favorites to progress into the final four of the competition and eliminate the holders when the two contest the second leg next Wednesday.
    

            After a cagey opening, in which Barcelona dominated possession, Real took the lead with their first meaningful attack on 11 minutes.
    

            Karim Benzema’s pass found Ronaldo scampering through the middle, and the Portuguese forward stepped past Gerard Pique before firing beyond Barca keeper Pinto.
    

            Ronaldo, who has been criticized by some fans for not celebrating some of his recent goals and for missing several chances in the last match with Barca, certainly looked like he enjoyed his opener.
    

            Five minutes later Barcelona striker Alexis Sanchez, from Chile, got on the end of Cesc Fabregas’ pass but though his looping header beat Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas, it bounced back off the post.
    

            Lionel Messi had his first sight of goal on 26 minutes as his low shot forced Casillas into a smart save at his near post. Andres Iniesta then made some room inside the penalty area but he fired wide after Sanchez’s lay off.
    

            But just three minutes into the second half Barcelona pulled level as their captain Carles Puyol stooped to head a corner into the net.
    

            Moments later Real defender Sergio Ramos deflected a volley from Iniesta onto the woodwork after a chipped pass from Fabregas.
    

            Real then hit the woodwork themselves as Benzema’s header cannoned back off the upright with Pinto beaten.
    

            Tempers frayed when Real’s Pepe appeared to stamp on Messi’s hand as the Argentine was on the floor after a foul before Barca edged in front with just over ten minutes to go.
    

            Abidal, who signed a new contract at the club this week, controlled Messi’s pass on his chest before shooting low into the net.
    

            In Italy, 
progressed to the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup but they needed extra time to beat Novara 2-1.
    

            Stephan El Shaarawy gave the Rossoneri the lead on 24 minutes with a curling shot but Ivan Radovanovic equalized for Serie A’s bottom club with a long range free kick two minutes from time.
    

            It was left to Milan’s Brazilian striker Pato to seal victory, ten minutes into the extra half an hour."
2018-11-09T12:00:55Z,Lewis Hamilton hints at Formula One exit if calendar expands further,"The Formula One season is the longest it has ever been.
    

            In 2018, for the second time in three years, drivers and teams have competed over the course of a 21-race season, spending more time away from families and homes.
    

            Now, with the announcement of a Vietnamese Grand Prix being added to the calendar from 2020, Lewis Hamilton has expressed his concern that the season is becoming unbearably long.
    

            

    

            

    

            “I am not going to be here if it gets to 25 races, that’s for sure,” Hamilton told reporters. 
    

            “It already feels like we are on race 25 this year, so I don’t think that’s a good thing. I think 18 was probably the best back in the day.”
    

            Despite next year also featuring 21 races, the schedule in 2019 means the F1 calendar will run into December for the first time in over 50 years.
    

            Liberty Media, the company that has owned Formula One since January 2017, has often expressed its hopes of expanding the season further.
    

            “I’m someone who really loves racing but the season is long,” Hamilton said. “It’s a lot of commitment for all of us and a lot of time away from families, and the seasons are getting longer and the off time is getting shorter.
    

            “All I can do is speak is for myself. The turnaround is so short, you start preparing for your next season often as soon as the season is done. 
    

            “Getting your mind turned. That’s very difficult. Then you have to find a way of switching off and recovering at the same time.”
    

            Hamilton wrapped up his fifth world title in Mexico a fortnight ago but the constructors’ championship is still to be decided.
    

            Ferrari must better Mercedes’ score in Brazil this weekend by 13 points or more if they want the title race to go to the season finale in Abu Dhabi."
2014-08-22T09:19:10Z,Russian convoy rolls into Ukraine: ‘Humanitarian’ aid or ‘direct invasion’?,"White House: Obama, Merkel agree Russian convoy is ""a provocation""
UK ambassador: Convoy ""has nothing to do with humanitarianism""
Lithuania official: Consul kidnapped, killed by ""terrorists""
Putin blames Ukraine, says it'd be ""unacceptable"" to delay sending convoy

            Is it an act of compassion or one of belligerence? 
    

            Both judgments were offered Friday on the dozens of Russian trucks that have rolled into eastern Ukraine, a move Russian leaders cast as necessary to address a humanitarian crisis and a Ukrainian official characterized as an “invasion” of his nation by its mighty neighbor to the east.
    

            While getting agreement on the right answer is impossible at this moment, there’s little doubt the actions have raised tensions to new levels – and that’s saying something, given the volatility over the past many months.
    

            The latest row revolves around aid going from Russia to Ukraine. Kiev had stalled trucks on the Russian side of the border for days, before acknowledging Sunday that the convoy, in fact, had humanitarian aid.
    

            That admission didn’t end the discord and debate. As of 11:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) Friday, 227 Russian vehicles had crossed into Ukraine, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has an observer mission at the checkpoint the convoy went through.
    

            All the vehicles were supposed to be monitored by members of the International Committee of the Red Cross. However, the Red Cross said it wasn’t accompanying them due to the “volatile security situation” – a reference to continued fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of directly and indirectly bolstering the rebel movement. The Kiev-based government and its allies – including the NATO alliance and its core member, the United States – see this convoy as perhaps Moscow’s most glaring, egregious move yet.
    

            “We call this a direct invasion for the first time under cynical cover of the Red Cross,” said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine’s security service.
    

            Right now, Ukraine isn’t planning to go after the convoy. Still, Nalyvaychenko thinks its main purpose is to supply rebels and its drivers are not even civilians.
    

            To Russian President Vladimir Putin, it is Ukraine’s government – not his – that’s being irresponsible and fueling instability in eastern Ukraine. 
    

            Putin expressed “serious concern” to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about endangered civilians and other impacts from Ukraine’s “continued (military) escalation,” according to the Kremlin.
    

            He further criticized what he characterized as “Kiev’s blatant attempts to hinder the delivery of Russian humanitarian aid” into southeast Ukraine, implying he had no choice but to act.
    

            “Further delay would have been unacceptable,” a Kremlin statement said.
    

            

    

            The international community hardly embraced Putin’s version of events.
    

            The British ambassador to the United Nations said that Russia had no support at a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday on the topic. The diplomat, Mark Lyall Grant, made no doubt about his own country’s views on the convoy’s entrance into Ukraine.
    

            “It is an undeniable and blatant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and clear breach of international law and the U.N. charter,” Lyall Grant told reporters. “It has nothing to do with humanitarianism.”
    

            NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned that the the “so-called humanitarian convoy … can only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel.”
    

            “The disregard of international humanitarian principles raises further questions about whether the true purpose of the aid convoy is to support civilians or to resupply armed separatists,” Rasmussen said in a statement.       
    

            Merkel talked not only with Putin – during which she voiced her “grave concern” – but also with U.S. President Barack Obama.
    

            The two leaders agreed that Ukraine “has continued to deteriorate since the tragic downing” of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, purportedly by pro-Russian rebels, the White House said. The pair concurred, too, that the convoy “is a further provocation and a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty” and called for the stop “of Russian personnel, military equipment and armored vehicles into eastern Ukraine.”
    

            Other U.S. officials laid into Russia publicly.
    

            Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said that Moscow has been told in “very, very clear (terms) that they should not be doing this under the guise of a humanitarian convoy, to use that as an excuse to cross the border in a non-authorized way.”
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “Russia must remove its vehicles and its personnel from the territory of Ukraine immediately,” Kirby told reporters. “Failure to do so will result in additional costs and isolation.”
    

        Russia must remove its vehicles and its personnel from the territory of Ukraine immediately.
    

            Pentagon spokesman John Kirby
        

            This view was seconded by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, who deemed the convoy – which he said his nation and its allies are tracking closely – “as part of a pattern of flagrant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.” The more Moscow does such things that stir instability in Ukraine, the more it will pay, according to Rhodes.
    

            “If (Russia does) not remove the convoys, we will be making determinations with our international partners about how to ratchet up the costs and consequences on them,” Rhodes said.
    

            

    

            It’s not just the Russian vehicles that crossed into Ukraine that are causing consternation. So, too, are the Russian troops massed at the border.
    

            There were up to 18,000 such “combat-ready” troops on Friday, a significant increase from previous public estimates by the Pentagon, according to a U.S. defense official with direct access to the latest information. 
    

            The official described the units as being in a “fully combat-capable offensive posture.”
    

            A second U.S. official said that many of the units were positioned at “crossroads and towns” two to 10 miles from the border. 
    

            “They are definitely more overt, aggressive and out in the open,” the official said. “They aren’t even hiding it.”
    

            The second official said the United States has believed for weeks that some Russian troops have crossed the border as part of the convoys of military gear and weapons moving from Russia into Ukraine.
    

            Of particular concern is the apparent transport of long-range and advanced systems including at least two SA-22 surface-to-air missile system and a number of pieces of longer-range artillery.
    

            The fear is that any advance of any kind could make the ongoing fighting – sparked last year by a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia – even worse. U.N. officials estimate that more than 2,000 people have died and nearly 5,000 have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April.
    

            The dead include Mykola Zelenec, Lithuania’s honor consul in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk, who Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said had been “kidnapped and brutally killed by terrorists.”
    

            Ukraine has time and again accused Russia of effectively fomenting rebellion by supporting rebels – including militarily – in eastern Ukraine, some of whom continue to hold territory there despite a push by Ukraine’s military.
    

            Russia has denied any direct support for the rebels while voicing sympathy for their fight for self-determination, saying that Kiev is in the wrong for its actions that endanger civilians – including many ethnic Russians.
    

            Even if the Russian military doesn’t explicitly march into Ukraine, there are concerns that it will find other ways to bolster the rebels.
    

            Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, insisted Friday that the current humanitarian convoy won’t be one of them.
    

            He told reporters that Russia received “official acceptance by Kiev authorities” for the convoy, and that Moscow is staying in touch with Ukrainian officials to make sure there are no problems in the process of distribution of the aid.

2022-02-04T11:20:30Z,Liverpool stars Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane to face off in AFCON final,"Liverpool teammates 
and Sadio Mane will come face to face in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) final after Egypt booked its place in Sunday’s game. 
    

            
 was awaiting the winner of Thursday’s semifinal between Cameroon and Egypt and, despite the host having the better chances, it was the Pharaohs who progressed on penalties. 
    

            Egyptian goalkeeper Mohamed Abou Gabal produced two brilliant saves in the shootout before Cameroon’s Clinton Njie fired his penalty wide of the post to send Egypt through after a goalless draw. 
    

            Egypt will now be bidding for a record-extending eighth AFCON title while Senegal looks to win its first. 
    

            Sunday’s final will also be the first of three matches between the two sides in the coming months with the teams pitted against each other in a two-legged playoff for a place in this year’s World Cup in Qatar. 
    

            Both Salah and Mane have spearheaded Liverpool’s success in recent seasons and they now carry the hopes of their nations on their backs. 
    

            Neither have been in lightning form during this year’s tournament but both have still scored goals, Mane netting three times and Salah twice. 
    

            

    

            Senegal last reached an AFCON final in 2019, eventually losing 1-0 to Algeria, and the current crop of players will certainly be feeling the weight of expectation to finally end the country’s wait for a title. 
    

            The current team – the top-ranked side on the continent – is full of talented players, representing clubs such as Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Liverpool and Bayern Munich.
    

            “Experience is a good asset,” Mane said. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “I think that has always been the case since the start of this tournament. We suffered so much with a lot of Covid cases and several injuries too.
    

            “We had a very difficult time, but with our experience, we kept calm until we recovered the whole group.
    

            “We played a final last time, so we have experience and we will try to win this trophy.”
    

            Egypt, meanwhile, have surprised many by making it so far in the tournament and have scraped through games without producing much exciting football. 
    

            Perhaps crucially, Egypt will be without manager Carlos Queiroz on the sideline for the final after the former Manchester United assistant was sent off for arguing with the referee in Thursday’s match. 
    

            Queiroz has been pivotal in making this Egyptian side hard to beat but will now watch from behind the scenes as the country looks to make yet more history. 
    

            It will once again look to rely on Salah who has been one of the best players in the world this season. 
    

            “We are happy, it’s true, but we have not yet reached the final objective,” Egypt’s assistant coach, Diaa Elsayed, said after the match. 
    

            “I can also add that our background is also due to the presence of one of the great players, namely Mohamed Salah. A very essential player in our team and who remains the centerpiece for us.”
    

            Salah posted videos to his Instagram story of the Egyptian players celebrating their semifinal victory on the team bus, but he will be looking to go one further to establish himself further as a serial winner."

Taxi drivers' association argues that Uber is unfair competition and lacks proper licenses
It is expected to file a formal complaint before the court; Uber can then make its case

            A Spanish judge on Tuesday temporarily banned cell phone-based taxi service Uber from operating in Spain after a complaint brought by taxi drivers in the capital, Madrid.
    

            The judge issued the ban, the equivalent of a temporary injunction, on the grounds that Uber was deemed to be causing damage to the taxi industry, a court spokesman said.
    

            The hearing was in response to a complaint by the Madrid taxi association, which argued that Uber is unfair competition and also lacks the proper municipal licenses to operate a taxi service.
    

            The Madrid taxi association is expected now to file a formal lawsuit with the court, after gathering more documents and information, the court spokesman said.
    

            Legal arguments for Uber were not heard before the judge because the company is located outside of Spain, in the U.S. state of Delaware, and the taxi industry was seeking immediate relief, he said.
    

            The company is expected to have a chance to argue its points before the judge when the formal lawsuit is filed.
    

            The Madrid ruling comes on the same day that 
 after an Uber driver was accused of raping a woman in New Delhi.

2020-04-03T14:24:02Z,"English Premier League players ‘thrown under a PR bus’ by clubs, says Gary Lineker","Adored by millions of fans around the world, 
 suddenly find themselves in an unusual position – a lightning rod for criticism from both the public and politicians amid the coronavirus pandemic.
    

            Earlier this week, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United, Norwich City and Bournemouth announced they would be using 
–  intended to aid those employers most severely affected by the Covid-19 shutdown – to help pay the wages of non-playing members of staff placed on temporary leave.
    

            However, with the 20 Premier League clubs sharing the spoils of the current multi-billion dollar TV rights deal, many questioned why the players – who earn on average £3 million ($3.7 million) per year – weren’t helping foot the bill.
    

            “I think everybody needs to play their part in this national effort and that means Premier League footballers too,” British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said during Thursday’s daily coronavirus briefing.
    

            “Given the sacrifices people are making, including some of my colleagues in the NHS, who have made the ultimate sacrifice and gone into work and caught the disease and have sadly died, I think the first thing Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution; take a pay cut and play their part.”
    

            

    

            The Professional Footballers Association (PFA) – the players’ union in England – has been holding talks with the Premier League and the English Football League (EFL) over soccer’s response to Covid-19 and one former leading player Gary Lineker, who now works as a TV pundit, told CNN that the football stars were convenient scapegoats for politicians.
    

            “We do tend to have a go at footballers quite easily,” former England international Gary Lineker told Richard Quest. “They’re easy game. Yes, they get paid a lot of money, but I’m sure they want to help. 
    

            “They’re consistently very good in the communities and I’m sure over the coming days that footballers will stand up and be counted, either taking pay cuts or making donations to charities or staff workers that are non-playing. 
    

            “So, I’m confident that will happen, but it takes time and everyone here is jumping on the bandwagon. Politicians do tend to do that occasionally, especially at football’s expense – so, if I’m wrong, then I’ll be as critical as everybody else.”
    

            In a statement released on Friday, the Premier League said it planned to start a consultation exercise with top-flight players.
    

            “In the face of substantial and continuing losses for the 2019/20 season since the suspension of matches began, and to protect employment throughout the professional game, Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to consult their players regarding a combination of conditional reductions and deferrals amounting to 30% of total annual remuneration.
    

            “The League will be in regular contact with the PFA, and the union will join a meeting which will be held tomorrow [April 4] between the League, players and club representatives.”
    

            

    

            This week, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid players took a 70% wage cut to ensure that all non-playing members of staff continue to get paid a full salary during the pandemic, while Juventus’ first-team squad has given up 100% of its wages for four months to save the club $100 million.
    

            “I think one or two of our clubs have kind of thrown their players under a PR bus in many ways by announcing that they’re cutting staff salaries and putting them on furlough, but not affecting the players’ wages,” said Lineker.
    

            “That was not announced by the players, but it was announced by the clubs, so let’s wait and see. Let’s be a little bit patient here. Let’s not all jump on the judgment high horse and just wait and see how it pans out over the next week or so. 
    

            “I’m confident and I would be very disappointed if the players don’t do the right thing, but I’m sure they will.”
    

            

    

            The PFA called an urgent meeting on March 27 with the Premier League and the EFL to ensure the salaries of footballers in the third and fourth tiers – whose wages, it says, are “closer to the national average” – were protected for April.
    

            “Many of these players will have contracts ending in June,” the PFA said in a statement on Thursday. “These are often people with young families, for whom their immediate financial position is uncertain.”
    

            While TV money has funded handsome salaries for many players, it’s arguably also benefited the super-rich owners of the 20 Premier League clubs, whose combined wealth totals close to $85 billion, according to Forbes.
    

            Which is why the the PFA says that while it is aware of the public’s belief that players should give up their salaries to pay the wages of non-playing members of staff, it reiterated its stance that if clubs can afford to pay both, then they should continue to do so.
    

            “The players we have spoken to recognize that the non-playing staff are a vital part of their club and they do not want to see club staff furloughed unfairly,” it said. “Any use of the government’s support schemes without genuine financial need is detrimental to the wider society. 
    

            “In instances where clubs have the resources to pay all staff, the benefit of players paying non-playing staff salaries will only serve the business of the club’s shareholders.”"
2016-12-27T16:53:56Z,Welsh football team equals Ajax’s 44-year-old world record,"Welsh side has won 26 consecutive matches 
Ajax set record in 1971-72 season 
The New Saints can break it on Dec 30

            Chelsea may be grabbing all the headlines with its impressive 12-match winning streak in the English Premier League, but that’s nothing compared to a team across the border in Wales.
    

            The New Saints FC notched a 26th consecutive win in the Welsh Premier League on Monday to equal the world record by set Dutch giant Ajax during 1971-72 Eredivisie season. 
    

            The four-time European champion tweeted its congratulations to the Welsh side, which cruised to a 4-0 victory over Cefn Druids in front of a home crowd. 
    
great achievement guys! Happy Boxing Day! 👊

            “It’s been a bit of a shock that we’ve got to this stage,” club chairman Mike Harris told CNN’s World Sport show Tuesday.  
    

            “We’d recognized that we’d got to the longest run of games in our league a few weeks ago when we passed the Bangor City total, but we still thought we had a bit of a way to go.”
    

            Harris and the club were only made aware of the feat when the Guinness Book of Records got in touch before the crucial match on Boxing Day.   
    

            

    

            “That got everyone a little bit on edge, but obviously the game went in our favor so we managed to get over that last hurdle,” Harris said. 
    

            “I think the players are a great set of players and you’ve also got to give great testimony to our manager Craig Harrison, who is very professional in the way that he treats every single game, every training session and in his selection of players he’s put together over the last few years.” 
    

            Harrison’s team has emulated an Ajax side that, featuring the great Johan Cruyff, went on to complete the treble in 1972 by winning the Eredivisie, the Dutch Cup and the European Cup – the precursor to today’s Champions League. 
    

            TNS, by comparison, has never made it past the qualifying rounds of the continent’s top club competition in 10 attempts.
    

      
      

      

    

            Now 21 points clear at the top of the 12-team Welsh Premier League, the team can break the world record when it plays second-bottom Cefn Druids again on Friday. 
    

            

    

            “There’s a lot of hard work going on in the Welsh Premier League,” said Harris, whose team has won the title for the past five seasons. 
    

            “It’s a very young league compared to the more established leagues in Europe, but the clubs have worked really, really hard over the last 20 years to keep pushing forward. 
    

            

    

            “It’s nice to get some recognition for all the hard work that’s gone on over that time.”"
2018-08-03T09:25:17Z,Andy Murray withdraws from Citi Open after grueling 3 a.m. victory,"Murray says he is exhausted after two three-set encounters in two days
The former No. 1 is returning from hip injury

            An emotional Andy Murray sobbed into his towel on the side of the court after a grueling victory over world No. 93 Marius Copil in Washington – a game that finished at 3 a.m. Friday local time.
    

            Hours later, tournament organizers confirmed
 that Murray had withdrawn from Washington’s Citi Open due to fatigue and would not play in the quarterfinals. He also will not compete in the Rogers Cup next week in Toronto, they said.
    

            “I’m exhausted after playing so much over the past four days, having not competed on the hard courts for 18 months,” Murray said in a statement. “I also need to be careful and to listen to my body as I come from a long-term injury.”
    

            Murray, who continues his return from hip surgery, overcame the Romanian 6-7 6-3 7-6 in his second three-set encounter in two days, having previously defeated fellow Briton Kyle Edmund. 
    
No words, 
. 
Just thanks for your emotions... 😍🙏
 

            “Just the emotions coming at the end of an extremely long day and a long match,” Murray, 31, said of his reaction to the Copil match, after which he sat crying into his towel for several minutes. 
    

            The former world No. 1 had to dig deep after conceding a 5-0 advantage in the first-set tie break to lose 7-5, but Murray twice broke Copil in the second set to force a decider.
    

            

    

            The pair shared breaks in the third set, and as the clock ticked on later into the night, Murray eventually emerged victorious (7-4) in the final tie break – at 3:01 a.m.
    

            The three-time grand slam winner has slipped to world No. 832 during his injury rehab and is now chasing his first ATP title since March 2017. 
    

            

    

            Murray would have faced Alex de Minaur in the quarterfinals in Washington. The Australian defeated South Korea’s Hyeon Chung 6-2 4-6 6-2."

 match turned ugly when a pitch invader ran on the field and punched the Spanish club’s goalkeeper Marko Dmitrović at the Philips Stadium in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
    

            Towards the end of the match, which resulted in PSV being eliminated from the tournament 3-2 on aggregate, the spectator can be seen on video walking up to Dmitrović before throwing a punch at his head.
    

      
      

      

    

            The 6-foot-4-inch Serbian goalkeeper quickly pinned down the pitch invader before security personnel arrived and escorted the assailant off the field.
    

            Dmitrović, who made the start in goal after starter 
 was scratched late due to illness, stayed in the game after the incident.
    

            “He pushed me from behind and then came and got in my face and tried to hit me,” Dmitrović said of the incident. 
    

            “He grazed the side of my nose a little and then honestly, I wanted to hit him back but it’s never pretty. If he really wants to fight let’s go to an event or a sport like boxing or anything. Here, in this sport, these things aren’t deserved but alas.
    

      
      

      

    

            “There’s always fans who are drunk and crazy and an idiot who assaults. This shouldn’t happen and I hope they punish him and anyone else who assaults anyone on the pitch in the future.”
    

            Six-time champion Sevilla cruised past PSV Eindhoven 3-0 in the first leg of the playoff, leaving the Dutch side with a tall task heading into Thursday night’s match.
    

            In the second leg, Luuk de Jong netted a goal in the 77th minute for PSV Eindhoven. 
    

            After the Dmitrović incident, substitute Fabio Silva doubled PSV’s lead five minutes into stoppage time but it was too little, too late as the full-time whistle would be blown shortly after.
    

            Despite the second-leg loss, Sevilla advances to the Round of 16."

Three-time Tour de France winner says bike is ""totaled""
Froome was training near his home in Monaco

            Three-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome has been knocked off his bike in a hit-and-run incident while training near Monaco.
    

            The British cyclist, who won the Tour in 2013, 2015 and 2016, tweeted a picture of his crumpled bike on Tuesday but confirmed he hadn’t been injured.
    

            He said: “Just got rammed on purpose by an impatient driver who followed me onto the pavement! Thankfully I’m okay. Bike totaled. Driver kept going!”
    
Just got rammed on purpose by an impatient driver who followed me onto the pavement! Thankfully I'm okay 🙏 Bike totaled. Driver kept going! 

            The Briton was riding in Beausoleil, close to his home in Monaco, when the incident took place. He is currently in training ahead of the Critérium du Dauphiné, an eight-day race in southern France that starts on June 4.
    

            

    

            

    

            The Critérium du Dauphiné forms part of the Kenyan-born cyclist’s preparations for his attempt to win a hat-trick of Tour de France titles, when the world’s most prestigious road race returns for its 104th edition.
    

            Italian cyclist and 2011 Giro d’Italia winner Michele Scarponi was killed in April when he was hit by a van when out on a training ride near his home in Filottrano, on the east coast.
    

            “This is a tragedy too big to be written,” his team Astana said in a statement about Scarponi, who had two young children with his wife Anna.
    

      
      

      

    

            Froome is a divisive figure in France.
    

            With the 
 still hanging over the Tour, Froome has been repeatedly accused of doping even though he insists he has always raced clean.
    

            He has been shouted at and spat on during the race, with one fan even throwing a cup of urine over him during the 2015 installment and calling him a doper.
    

            In an eventful race last year, Froome was fined for lashing out at a spectator who ran too close to him and decided to briefly jog up the famous Mont Ventoux after a crash wiped out his bike.
    

            The 31-year-old Froome says he sees himself as a spokesman for clean cycling and insists the recent controversy surrounding Team Sky will not affect his legacy.
    

            His team has been rocked by a UK Anti-Doping inquiry after revelations that a mystery package was delivered to Bradley Wiggins at an event shortly before his 2011 Tour win.
    

            Team Sky boss Dave Brailsford appeared before a Parliament select committee to reveal the decongestant Fluimucil was in the package bound for Wiggins. 
    

            Questions have also been asked about how Team Sky used therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), which are essentially doctor’s notes enabling athletes to use medicines that would otherwise be banned.
    

            Wiggins has come under particular scrutiny over his use of TUEs for the banned anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone as well as that package that was delivered by British Cycling coach Simon Cope during the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine tour.
    

            Wiggins has yet to publicly comment on the UKAD inquiry though in March he told Sky Sports’ Soccer AM show: “Fortunately there’s an investigation and I obviously can’t say too much because that will run its course and then I’ll have my say.
    

            “There’s a lot to say and it’s going to shock a few people.” 
    

            

    

            Team Sky have constantly maintained that while they may have handled the situation badly, nothing untoward took place."
2019-09-20T05:26:55Z,Nine years of austerity have stripped thousands of disabled Brits of support they need to survive,"Sarifa Patel’s 500-foot trip to her nearest bus stop takes half an hour. Walking is painful and she needs several breaks. Patel, who lives in east London, has a wheelchair, but since undergoing surgery a few years ago she no longer has the strength to push herself.
    

            The 60-year-old doesn’t want to give up her part-time job at a charity, so requested a mobility scooter through a government scheme aimed at helping disabled people access employment. She has been waiting for three years.
    

            A decade of austerity policies and deep cuts to social services and 
 in the United Kingdom has made it difficult for people like Patel to access the care they need. A 2018 report by a UN human rights expert said government policy has “
 … on people with disabilities who are already marginalized.”
    

            The future is also uncertain. New UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged more money for the cash-strapped National Health Service. Johnson’s hardline approach to Brexit, however, increases the likelihood of the country leaving the European Union without a deal, with potentially damaging economic consequences 
    

            According to forecasts by the 
 and the 
, a no-deal Brexit would likely push the UK into a deep recession and put public spending under pressure. It was the last recession, sparked by the global financial crisis in 2008, that led to the austerity measures that the UN says have decimated Britain’s social services.

    

            For Patel, the situation is difficult now. She 
, a long-term condition that causes pain, muscle spasms and stiffness. Sometimes it is so bad she can’t walk at all. 
    

            “I’ve been really struggling with my knees, but they’ve not listened to me,” she says of her scooter request.
    

            The UK government’s Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), which is responsible for disability benefits, would not comment on Patel’s individual case.
    

      
      

      

    

            If Patel really needs to go somewhere, her only option is to take a cab. Patel spends roughly £200 ($242) a month on taxis. It’s money she says she wouldn’t have to spend if she wasn’t disabled.
    

            That’s a common story. Scope, a UK disability charity, said the average “disability price tag” comes to £583 ($706) a month. 
    

            “That’s the amount disabled people have to spend on things that non-disabled people don’t need,” James Taylor, Scope’s head of policy, told CNN.
    

            This figure includes buying and repairing special equipment, as well as spending money on everyday goods and services that disabled people have to use a lot more often, Taylor said. 
    

            The extra cost has grown in recent years. Following the global economic crisis, successive UK governments attempted to save money by reforming Britain’s welfare system. 
    

            These changes were meant to make the system leaner and more streamlined, replacing “outdated” benefits with new ones. But the reform proved difficult for many people living with disabilities.
    

            “It was designed as more cost-effective and less generous,” Taylor said. 
    

            “We are finding people who were getting the previous benefit are no longer able to get the new one, so there is a group of disabled people who have been hit very hard,” he added.
    

            Latest available DWP 
 show that as of last October, 47% of people who were receiving the old disability benefit, known as Disability Living Allowance, had their payments reduced or scrapped altogether after transferring to the new system, called Personal Independence Payment.
    

            That is intentional: the government expected the reform would mean around 
.
    

      
      

      

    

            It said that the point was to make the system more sustainable and focused on those with the greatest needs.
    

            A DWP spokesperson said the new system is better because it is “taking a much wider look at the way a person’s health condition or disability impacts them on a daily basis.” 
    

            But Scope said some disabled people have lost £300 to £400 a month because of the changes. “That has a huge impact on what they’re able to afford, and the quality of life that they have,” Taylor said. 
    

            Most people switching to the new system have to go through an official assessment to determine the level of care and mobility assistance they need. 
    

            The requirements became stricter under the new system. For example, it used to be that anyone unable to walk 50 meters (164 feet) without aid would qualify for higher mobility support payments.
    

            Under the new system, only people who can’t 
. That means that those who can walk over 20 meters but not 50 have suddenly had their payments slashed, even though their condition has not changed.
    

            A DWP spokesperson said the rule was not set in stone and that even people who can walk more than 20 meters can still get the higher rate if they “cannot do so safely, to an acceptable standard, repeatedly or in a reasonable time period.”
    

            Patel was “downgraded” in 2016. She slumped from “higher” to “standard” support rates, resulting in more than £60 cut to her weekly payments. 
    

            “And then when I spoke to the wheelchair services people, they said I should be able to buy a scooter from the mobility benefit,” Patel said. She said a scooter or electric chair 
. Even if she was able to put money aside, it would take her years to save up enough to buy one. 
    

            She has tried to have the decision to lower her payments overturned and got a new assessment from a different doctor. She is now waiting for a tribunal.
    

      
      

      

    

            The tribunal odds are on Patel’s side. According to the Ministry of Justice, 
 against disability payments decisions are successful.
But the appeal process is time consuming, taking on average almost a year. In the meantime, the person appealing is stuck without funds. 
    

            “It inflicts hardship on people, because in many cases, most or a large portion of their income is withdrawn,” said Sara Reis, research and policy officer at the UK Women’s Budget Group, a research organization. 
    

            “And there will be many people who won’t go through the appeal process because it’s an onerous thing and it can be daunting, intimidating to stand before a tribunal and state your case,” she added.
    

            While she awaits that decision, Patel hopes that when her next big muscle spasm comes, she won’t be out and about. Freezing up in the street makes her feel vulnerable. 
    

            “I get really frustrated and angry because I can be walking… and the next minute, my muscle spasms up in my leg, and it becomes like a pencil… it’s frightening.”"
2023-09-23T06:08:25Z,"Never ‘insult Poles again,’ Poland’s prime minister tells Ukraine’s Zelensky","Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has told Volodymyr Zelensky never to “insult Poles again” after the 
 president suggested his neighbor was putting on a show over their disputes on grain exports.
    

            The Polish leader fired back at Zelensky after the Ukrainian leader offered a veiled criticism of Poland at the United Nations’ general assembly this week, saying the dispute was “political theater” and that “some of our friends in Europe” have “made a thriller from the grain.”
    

            On Friday, at a rally in Swidnik, Poland, Morawiecki hit back.
    

            “I want to tell President Zelensky never to insult Poles again, as he did recently during his speech at the UN,” he said.
    

            “The Polish people will never allow this to happen, and defending the good name of Poland is not only my duty and honor, but also the most important task of the Polish government,” the Polish prime minister added.
    

      
      

      

    

            The comments by Morawiecki risk deepening the divisions between two countries that have previously been close allies united against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
    

            Tensions between them have been rising in recent weeks over a ban on Ukrainian grain, initially put in place earlier this year by several EU nations to protect the livelihood of local farmers worried about being undercut by the low price of Ukrainian grain.
    

            The EU announced plans to suspend the ban last week but 
 – alongside Hungary and Slovakia – said it would stick with it, sparking protests from Ukraine, which filed lawsuits against the three countries, and, subsequently, Zelensky’s comments at the UN.
    

            Poland immediately condemned Zelensky’s comments at the UN and its foreign ministry summoned the Ukrainian ambassador to convey its “strong protest.” Hours later, the Polish prime minister said in a blunt social media statement that the country would “no longer transfer weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland.”
    

            That had seemed to indicate a major change in policy: until now, Poland has been one of the most forthright countries in the race to get weapons and resources into Ukrainian hands.
    

            But Polish President Andrzej Duda on Thursday moved to walk back his prime minister’s comments, saying they were “interpreted in the worst possible way.”
    

            He said Morawiecki had merely been referring to new weapons being purchased for the Polish army, and that older weapons systems Warsaw deems not necessary for modernizing its own military could still be shipped across the border.
    

            NATO and European sources 
 that the Polish stance may be an attempt to woo farmers with elections due next month. 
    

            Poland has long been one of Ukraine’s staunchest allies, alongside multiple former Eastern bloc nations which fear they could be next if Russian President Vladimir Putin’s expansionist war is successful.
    

            In another sign of disenchantment over Ukraine in Eastern Europe, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has said new sanctions against Russia are not needed because they “cause more harm to Europe than Russia.”
    

            Szijjarto made the comments in an interview with Russian state media TASS on Friday following his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. 
    

            “If we look at the sanctions from a pragmatic point of view, we see that they cause more harm to Europe than to Russia,” he said, according to TASS, adding that “the new packages of sanctions are not necessary.” 
    

            Szijjarto also said that supplies of Ukrainian grain to Central European countries will destroy their agricultural sector. 
    

            “If Ukrainian grain starts to spread into Central European countries, it will definitely destroy the agricultural markets of Central Europe. Not to mention our farmers, whom we obviously need to protect,” Szijjarto continued, as cited by TASS."
2017-06-22T10:04:55Z,Step inside the kitchen of an F1 masterchef,"Michael Caines fueling F1 drivers
Award-winning chef works for Williams F1

            When Michael Caines lost his right arm in a car accident in 1994, the dream of becoming a top-level chef seemed a million miles away.
    

            Twenty-three years and two Michelin stars later, he hasn’t just become one of his industry’s most distinguished figures, he’s also fueling some of the fastest drivers in the world.
    

            A partner and ambassador for Formula One team Williams Martini Racing, the 48-year-old hosts the team’s sponsors, engineers and drivers on race weekends. 
    

            “I grew up watching Williams dominate in that era of Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill being made World Champions for this great racing team,” says Caines, who has built an empire of 
 in the United Kingdom.
    

            “You see your heroes on TV and think ‘wow!’ … and the next thing you know, you find yourself in the paddock. 
    

            “It is one of those pinch-yourself moments”
    

            F1 has a relentless race calendar which runs from March to November and stops in 20 major cities. But from Australia to Abu Dhabi, the Brit shows it’s possible to produce top-quality cuisine on the move. 
    

            “They say an army marches on its stomach and Williams is no exception,” Caines tells CNN The Circuit. 
    

            “We’ve got to produce nutritious and healthy food for the drivers, but we’ve also got to provide for the sponsors over the F1 weekend.” 
    

            His team designed a purpose-built motorhome four years ago to deliver a bespoke product for the Williams team and its numerous guests.  
    

            It can be quickly assembled at any location on the F1 circuit to deliver the optimum culinary experience, with a ground floor brasserie and first floor Michael Caines Tasting Experience.
    

            It might not be perfect, but as the chef puts it: “We get pretty close to what I do in my restaurants here on the track!”

            Caines stresses the importance of a good diet for drivers, especially since this year’s new rulings have made the sport even more physically demanding. 
    

            Even if Williams drivers Felipe Massa and Lance Stroll probably won’t be troubling the top of the drivers’ standings at the end of this season, there’s little doubt the British team is well catered for especially, says Caines, when compared with what their rivals offer. 
    

            “There’s no competition!” laughs Caines. “We out-qualify all of them!”
    

            “Toto Wolff will tell you. The first thing he said when he went to Mercedes was ‘we want our hospitality to be just like Williams’.”
    

            

    

            Not that Massa and Stroll are devouring
 before races. 
    

            Because drivers are out on the road so much, the most important ingredient is a taste of home.
    

            Both eat at a particular time on race weekends – “written in as part of the day” – and tend to not change their diet. 
    

            Stroll, an F1 debutant of Canadian descent, typically eats quinoa and high protein fish, like salmon or cod. 
    

            Massa, the first Brazilian since Ayrton Senna to win his home Grand Prix, rarely deviates from a dish of roast chicken, wild rice and tomato salad.
    

            “Everyone has to be made to feel welcome,” says Caines. “When they’re not having to worry about racing, they’ll also indulge off the menu!”
    

            

    

            The chef admits sponsors are “so key to survival” for today’s F1 teams.
    

            It’s a fact Williams has embraced, going through 2,000 bottles of Prosecco over the course of the 2016 season.
    

            “If results aren’t always what they should be on the track, at least through hospitality you can give the sponsors a great experience throughout the race weekend,” says Caines. 
    

            “I’m always thinking about how we can bring in different themes to different grands prix, whether that’s the cocktails or the food. 
    

            “We always try to influence that with the wine choices as well – English wines going alongside some of the dishes too.”
    

            The opportunity to experiment is offset by the difficulty obtaining ingredients in some race locations. 
    

            He praises the produce on offer in Monaco, lauding “the fantastic larder of fantastic seafood and salads,” but adds it can be slightly more challenging cooking in the likes of Russia and Hungary. 
    

            Still, with opportunity to watch races in between his cooking, Caines is in no doubt as to just how lucky he is. 
    

            “I derive a lot of satisfaction from the fact that something I loved as a kid is something I’m now in touch with,” he smiles. 
    

            

    

            “It’s a team sport and it goes without saying that everyone involved with Williams is here to support the team to go on, race and hopefully win.”"
2020-10-22T13:25:27Z,Baby gorilla hand-reared by zookeepers after mother struggles to look after him,"Zookeepers in the British city of Bristol
are giving a baby 
 round-the-clock care, including bottle feeding through the night, as his mother has been struggling to look after him.
    

            The team of keepers at Bristol Zoo Gardens said
that the baby, now two months old but still unnamed, was not getting enough milk from his mother, Kala, to survive and would now be hand-reared for the next four months.
    

            “Hand-rearing any animal is not a decision we take lightly as our preference is always for an animal to be reared naturally by its own mother,” Lynsey Bugg, mammals curator at the zoo, said in a statement. 
    

            “Sadly, this doesn’t always happen and in this instance we decided that it was in the baby gorilla’s best interests for us to hand rear him to ensure he had the best chance of survival.” 
    

            Kala, the baby’s mother, is said to be adjusting well and is in good health. 
    

            Bugg said that when the infant is away from his mother at night in onsite accommodation, zookeepers will try to treat him like his gorilla mother would, expecting him to hold on tight to them and making gorilla vocalizations.
    

            During the day, the infant will be in the zoo’s Gorilla House. It is hoped that if the animals are able to see, smell, touch, and be near him, the infant will soon be able to bond with the group and be accepted as a part of the family, the statement said.
    

            Zookeepers are keeping the baby gorilla out of public view for now, but visitors can view the rest of the group.
    

            The zoo invited members of the public to help choose a name 
. The options are: Motuku, meaning “Chief of the Village” in Bubi, a local language in Equatorial Guinea; Hasani, meaning “handsome” in Swahili; Luango, a town on the coast of Equatorial Guinea; or Kidosi, popular Central African name."
2020-06-18T17:10:37Z,German prosecutor accuses Russia of ordering murder in Berlin park,"Germany’s top prosecutor has accused 
 of ordering the murder of a Georgian man in a Berlin park, as they announced that a suspected contract killer has been charged over the killing. 
    

            The victim was a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of 
 descent named by German officials as Tornike K. He was shot dead by a man on a bicycle in downtown Berlin’s Kleiner Tiergarten park on August 23, 2019. Previously named as 
, the former Chechen fighter had been on his way to midday prayers.
    

            A Russian national was arrested within hours over the killing, setting off a murder mystery that has gripped Germany.
    

            While the Kremlin has denied any connection between the murder and the Russian state, the shooting triggered an investigation which also raised uncomfortable questions about the relationship between the two countries.
    

      
      

      

    

            Germany’s federal prosecutor took over the investigation in December. On Thursday, almost ten months after the murder, they said they had gathered sufficient evidence and brought charges against the suspect.
    

            “At an unknown date before July 18, 2019, the accused received the order from authorities at the central government of the Russian Federation to liquidate the Georgian national of Chechen origin,” the prosecutor’s statement reads.
    

            The suspect, named as Vladim K., is accused of the murder and of illegal possession of a weapon, the statement added.
    

            “The indictment by the federal prosecutor contains serious accusations regarding the involvement of Russian state authorities in the so-called Tiergarten murder case,” a German government spokesperson said Thursday, adding: “The Federal Government takes this very seriously.”
    

            The spokesperson said the German government would “carefully monitor” the rest of the trial until a verdict was reached, adding that two members of the Russian embassy were expelled in December in connection to the case, and that recently Germany had taken steps against Russia in connection with the hacking attack on the German Bundestag in 2015. 
    

            “The German government reserves the right to take further steps,” the statement concluded.

2020-02-16T05:23:12Z,Victims thought they were paying millions to free hostages. But the ‘minister’ who asked them was a fraudster in a mask,"There was a sense of urgency in the voice of the man claiming to be 
 defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian.
    

             “We’re talking about the lives of 
 citizens and we would like to free them. If we don’t, we expect the worst,” the man said in an audio recording of a telephone solicitation obtained by CNN. 
    

            “I need to know if you can join us in this mission so we can carry it out and if the answer is ‘yes’ then I will alert the presidency to say we have someone who can act as a mediator for us.” 
    

            On the receiving end of the telephone line was Olivier de Boisset, a Frenchman who heads an IT company in Niger.
    

            De Boisset was being asked to wire over 2 million dollars to allegedly help free French hostages being held by terrorists in Mali.
    

            The voice said France needed de Boisset’s help transferring funds because officially the country does not pay ransoms and gave assurances that France’s central bank would reimburse him.
    

            De Boisset was suspicious, but he could never have imagined the extent of the scam that was being played on him.
    

            Not only were there no French hostages in Mali, but he had just become the latest victim in a multi-million dollar con that would span two years and target more than 150 people including the spiritual leader Aga Khan, the President of Niger, the Prime Minister of Norway, the Archbishop of Lyon, the owner of Chateau Margaux wines, the King of Belgium, the director general of UNESCO and numerous CEOs.
    

            Attempts to extort money from embassies and governments were made in more than 50 countries, according to French court documents.
    

            CNN has obtained exclusive recordings made by often-skeptical victims showing how a group of fraudsters tried to pull off what some in France are calling the scam of the century by impersonating France’s then defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, and conning wealthy individuals out of 80 million euros purportedly to help pay ransoms to free French hostages being held by Islamist terrorists.
    

            Some of the money has not been recovered.
    

            Six of the alleged fraudsters are currently on trial in Paris in connection with the Le Drian hoax and a plot to impersonate Prince Albert II of Monaco while a seventh defendant is on trial only for the Albert of Monaco plot. 
    

            According to many of the victims, to earn their trust an initial phone call was followed up by a Skype video call. During this exchange, the con artist wore a custom-made silicone mask of Le Drian’s face and sat in a replica of the minister’s office complete with both the tricolor flag of France and a flag of Europe, pictures in the court documents show.
    

            Another one of those targeted in June 2016 by the bogus Le Drian was Bruno Paillard, who heads a champagne house in Reims, northern France.
    

            Paillard told CNN the hustle was impressive because of its elaborate nature. “The image was not very precise and the voice was a little bit strange. The excuse was that they were in a bunker in the ministry,” Paillard said.
    

            In addition to the Skype calls, Paillard said they communicated with him on official-looking letterheads from the ministry, but despite all their efforts Paillard said he wasn’t convinced and went straight to the police. 
    

            “As a champagne producer we make people happy, but we’re not necessarily good at saving the lives of people who are being held in strange countries,” Paillard told CNN.
    

            Paillard said the fake Le Drian had done his homework, he even knew how many children he had.
    

            Wine maker Guy-Petrus Lignac was equally astonished at how much the fraudsters knew about him. He said they drew on his background to appeal to his sense of patriotism.  
    

      
      

      

    

            “They knew so many things about me! That I had been a police officer in the past. That’s not common knowledge, it’s not on the internet. I was surprised,” Lignac told CNN. 
    

            Many of the victims were skeptical and went to the defense ministry to report the calls. The ministry alerted investigators in the summer of 2015 and an investigation was opened in April 2016, according to court documents.
    

            Lawyers for Le Drian said French embassies all over the world were warned of the scam in 2016. However, the ministry didn’t see the need for a press conference. 
    

            Turkish businessman Inan Kirac, was duped in November 2016 and over the course of one month handed over $47 million in nine transfers to bank accounts in China – the largest sum to be wired to the fraudsters by one individual.
    

            Kirac eventually realized he was being scammed and began taping the conversations.
    

            In an audio recording obtained by CNN Kirac is heard speaking with a man impersonating an aide to Le Drian.
    

            “Mr. Kirac, first of all, I wanted to express my condolences concerning the attack in Istanbul and I learned that two of your very close friends were injured in this attack,” the voice on the crackly line is heard saying.
    

            “I hope that 2016 will be a good year to defeat crime and the terrorists who deserve to go to hell,” the man said.
    

            Kirac believed his money was being used to free two French journalists who were allegedly being held hostage in Syria.
    

            Delphine Meillet, the lawyer representing the actual Le Drian, who is now France’s foreign minister, told CNN the fraudsters used the war in Syria to their advantage. 
    

            “There were real hostages at the time, in 2015, and the technique to convince them was to play on fears of terrorism,” Meillet said.
    

            “When the state asks you to do it a favor, to help fight terrorism, how can you say no? How can you say no to a minister?” she added.
    

      
      

      

    

            The voice of the fake Le Drian is allegedly that of Gilbert Chikli, according to prosecutors, a Franco-Israeli accused of being the mastermind behind the sting. He is charged with organized fraud and usurping a person’s identity. Chikli denies the charges.
    

            Meillet describes the 54-year-old as being a modern-day Victor Lustig, the notorious con man who sold the Eiffel Tower to a scrap-metal dealer in 1925, not once but twice.
    

            Chikli has a checkered past. In 2015, he was sentenced in absentia to seven years in prison for a brazen scam where he posed as prominent French CEOs in order to extort millions of euros from companies. The hoax was later the subject of a movie “Thank You for Calling” that paid Chikli as a consultant, according to court documents. 
    

            In 2017 the Parisian was arrested in Ukraine and according to court documents evidence was found on Chikli’s cell phone showing that Google searches for “silicone mask Kiev” and “Prince of Monaco” had been made.”
    

            Another defendant in the trial, Anthony Lasarevitsch, was arrested in Kiev alongside Chikli. Investigators found pictures of a silicone mask of Prince Albert II of Monaco on his cell phone.
    

            Lasarevitsch faces the same charges as Chikli, and denies any wrongdoing. His lawyer said in court that Lasarevitsch had been “dragged into the case by the media” after his arrest alongside Chikli “was broadcast to the masses.”
    

            A clip of Chikli, while incarcerated in Kiev, surfaced on social media in 2017 showing him having a fridge delivered to the prison. In the video Chikli says “this is what I’ve bought, a fridge, so I can eat some entrecote. We are the bosses!”
    

            Chikli was eventually extradited to France. He is currently in prison serving time for the CEO hoax. He’s admitted taking part in the CEO scam but says he’s not the mastermind.
    

            On Monday experts testified that the voice of the fake Le Drian bore a striking resemblance to that of Chikli.
    

            Chikli defended himself vehemently in court Monday.
    

            “What can I tell you? They’ve got it wrong!” he shouted.  
    

            “There are 20 billion cases like this per year, I’ve got nothing to do with this! I have no answers to your questions,” Chikli growled.
    

            His lawyer, Stephane Sebag, told CNN that the whole of the prosecution was based on weak analysis of the voice samples from Chikli’s interviews and that the recordings of the scam “are very poor.”
    

            “This is not enough to convince anyone of his guilt,” Sebag said.
    

            If convicted Chikli faces up to 14 years in prison and a 2 million euro fine. A verdict is expected on March 11.
    

            The real Le Drian reacted to the scam last year. “You can’t impersonate me, if you do then you go to prison,” he said.
    

            “They were pretty convincing and sadly there were victims. They did a good job of imitating my voice,” Le Drian added.

2020-08-31T11:57:44Z,Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal among critics of Novak Djokovic’s new players’ association,"has been left divided following the launch of a breakaway players’ association, with 
and Rafael Nadal among those to criticize its formation. 
    

            The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) was unveiled on Sunday as a body separate to the ATP Tour and tennis’ first player-only council since 1972. 
    

            It is being spearheaded by world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and 94th-ranked Vasek Pospisil, who said it is “very difficult, if not impossible, to have any significant impact on any major decisions” within the current structure alongside the ATP. 
    

            Djokovic, who continued his unbeaten streak in 2020 as he won the Western & Southern Open in New York, also said the current setup is “quite complex.”
    

            He told reporters after his victory over 
: “This is not a new idea. This hasn’t been something that came out of the blue. This has been a project for many players and many different generations over the last 20-plus years.
    

            “I certainly think it’s the right step forward for the players, because I think it unifies the players. It allows them to have a platform, to have an association through which they will be able to express themselves better where they will be able to talk about the ideas, the interests, and the things that are related to the players.”
    

            He added that he believes the PTPA can coexist alongside the ATP Tour, but in a statement the governing body of men’s tennis underlined the need for unity within the sport.
    

            

    

            “The governance structure of the ATP Tour provides players with equal seats at the table on every major decision affecting the circuit. We recognize the challenges that our members face in today’s circumstances,” the statement read.
    

            “However we strongly believe that now is a time for unity, rather than internal division. We remain unwavering in our commitment to deliver for our players across all areas of our business, ensuring they receive maximum benefit from their years on Tour, and that their voices are heard.
    

            “In parallel, we remain committed to working closely with the other governing bodies of tennis as we look to fulfill the true potential of our sport. Only as a unified sport can we truly focus on the fan experience, engage new audiences, and ensure that tennis continues to thrive.”
    

            Federer and Nadal, the most decorated players in the men’s game, spoke out against the PTPA.
    

      
      

      

    

            “The world is living a difficult and complicated situation. I personally believe these are times to be calm and work all of us together in the same direction. It is time for unity, not for separation,” Nadal said on social media.
    

            “These are moments where big things can be achieved as long as the world of tennis is united. We all, players, tournaments and governing bodies, have to work together. We have a bigger problem and separation and disunion is definitely not the solution.”
    

            

    

            Federer, who earlier this year called for tennis to merge its men’s and women’s governing bodies, agreed that it is time “to stand united as players, and as a sport,” while three-time grand slam champion Andy Murray questioned the absence of female players in the new association.
    

            Pospisil said there is “active dialogue with the women’s side” to incorporate female players in the PTPA. 
    

            The launch of the association comes on the eve of the 
, which gets underway in Flushing Meadows on Monday.
    

            A number of top players will not play in the tournament amid the coronavirus pandemic, including Federer and Nadal on the men’s side and top-ranked Ashleigh Barty and Simona Halep on the women’s. 
    

            Djokovic and Murray, who continues his return from a career-threatening hip injury, will compete in the men’s draw, while Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams are among the high-profile participants in the women’s singles. 
    

            As in the NBA and the Champions League, players will live in bubbles around New York, either in tournament-sanctioned hotels or private accommodation."
2023-06-06T11:08:52Z,Tennis star Miyu Kato in tears as she struggles to answer questions about controversial disqualification,"A day after being controversially 
 from the 
 for inadvertently hitting a ball girl with a ball, an emotional 
struggled to answer questions about the incident. 
    

            Kato and her partner Aldila Sutjiadi were defaulted from the doubles event on Sunday after the Japanese player struck a ball girl having innocuously hit the ball to the back of the court following a point.
    

      
      

      

    

            Kato, who was seen crying on court after her disqualification, was back in action on Monday and reached the mixed doubles semifinals after winning in straight sets alongside German partner Tim Puetz. 
    

            It’s widely reported that Kato was in tears on court after winning the quarterfinal and was visibly emotional in the press conference afterward, leaving the room momentarily to compose herself before a question was answered. 
    

            “I think, first and foremost, we’re all, including Miyu, happy that the ball girl is okay because obviously she got hit,” Puetz told reporters after coming back into the room with Kato.

            A tearful Kato gave a very short answer in Japanese, saying it was difficult for her to speak English at this time. 
    

            While Puetz understood why officials made the decision, he said there was clearly no intent to hurt the ball girl. 
    

            “I understand she hit the ball girl. It was not intentional. I don’t think it was in anger,” he added.
    

            “I think everybody saw the pictures. It wasn’t anything malicious that she did. Nevertheless, it hit the ball girl.

            “In that moment, to make that decision, is very difficult.”
    

            On Monday, Kato tweeted an apology to the ball girl, her doubles partner and her supporters, saying the incident was

2019-08-06T10:35:14Z,Schalke chairman Clemens Tönnies faces calls to quit after making racist comments,"The chairman of a leading German football club is under growing pressure to resign after making racist comments about African people during a speech last week.
    

            Schalke chairman Clemens Tönnies criticized tax increases to fight climate change while speaking at a
festival in the western city of Paderborn, suggesting instead that money be used to fund power plants in Africa.
    

            “Then the Africans would stop cutting down trees and stop producing children when it’s dark,” Tönnies was quoted as saying by regional German 

    

            He has since apologized for his remarks and said he supports Schalke’s values against “racism, discrimination and exclusion.”
    

            The club told CNN that their ethics body will be discussing his remarks soon, in an upcoming meeting.  
    

            “I would like to explicitly apologize to you, the fans, members and friends of FC Schalke 04,” Tönnies said in 
on the club’s website. “It was wrong, thoughtless … and in no way met our mission statement. I am very sorry.” 
    

      
      

      

    

            But politicians and some fans of the Bundesliga club have urged him to quit, and the German Football Association (DFB) is under pressure to discipline the businessman.
    

            Germany’s Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht has led calls for Tönnies’ comments to be punished. “Racism must be loudly and clearly contradicted,” she told newspapers of the Funke media group. 
    

            “Nowhere is integration as successful and quick to work as in sport – that must not be put at risk,” Lambrecht added.
    

            SDP lawmaker Markus Töns 
: “The racist statement by Clemens Tönnies at the “Day of Crafting” in Paderborn is incompatible with the mission statement of Schalke 04.”
    

            And Dagmar Freitag, who chairs the sports committee in Germany’s parliament, argued that Tönnies’ apology cannot make up for the damage his remarks caused.
    

            “That something like this (is) articulated by someone who holds a prominent position in the sport makes things even worse,” she told German newspaper Welt, adding that his explanation “certainly can not make up for the socio-political damage.” 
    

            CNN has asked the DFB for comment.

2012-01-18T23:08:50Z,Abidal pounces late as Barcelona edge ‘El Clasico’ over Real Madrid,"Barcelona beat Real Madrid 2-1 in their Spanish Cup quarterfinal first leg tie
French defender strikes 13 minutes from time as holders suffer defeat at home stadium
Cristiano Ronaldo had given Real the lead before Carles Puyol equalized
Milan beat Novara to progress into the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup

            A late goal from Eric Abidal gave Barcelona a 2-1 comeback victory in the first leg of their Spanish Cup quarterfinal clash with arch rivals Real Madrid.
    

            The French defender scored the decisive goal in the match known as ‘El Clasico’ at Real’s Bernabeu stadium after Barcelona captain Carles Puyol had canceled out Cristiano Ronaldo’s opener.
    

            It means Barcelona are favorites to progress into the final four of the competition and eliminate the holders when the two contest the second leg next Wednesday.
    

            After a cagey opening, in which Barcelona dominated possession, Real took the lead with their first meaningful attack on 11 minutes.
    

            Karim Benzema’s pass found Ronaldo scampering through the middle, and the Portuguese forward stepped past Gerard Pique before firing beyond Barca keeper Pinto.
    

            Ronaldo, who has been criticized by some fans for not celebrating some of his recent goals and for missing several chances in the last match with Barca, certainly looked like he enjoyed his opener.
    

            Five minutes later Barcelona striker Alexis Sanchez, from Chile, got on the end of Cesc Fabregas’ pass but though his looping header beat Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas, it bounced back off the post.
    

            Lionel Messi had his first sight of goal on 26 minutes as his low shot forced Casillas into a smart save at his near post. Andres Iniesta then made some room inside the penalty area but he fired wide after Sanchez’s lay off.
    

            But just three minutes into the second half Barcelona pulled level as their captain Carles Puyol stooped to head a corner into the net.
    

            Moments later Real defender Sergio Ramos deflected a volley from Iniesta onto the woodwork after a chipped pass from Fabregas.
    

            Real then hit the woodwork themselves as Benzema’s header cannoned back off the upright with Pinto beaten.
    

            Tempers frayed when Real’s Pepe appeared to stamp on Messi’s hand as the Argentine was on the floor after a foul before Barca edged in front with just over ten minutes to go.
    

            Abidal, who signed a new contract at the club this week, controlled Messi’s pass on his chest before shooting low into the net.
    

            In Italy, 
progressed to the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup but they needed extra time to beat Novara 2-1.
    

            Stephan El Shaarawy gave the Rossoneri the lead on 24 minutes with a curling shot but Ivan Radovanovic equalized for Serie A’s bottom club with a long range free kick two minutes from time.
    

            It was left to Milan’s Brazilian striker Pato to seal victory, ten minutes into the extra half an hour."
2018-11-09T12:00:55Z,Lewis Hamilton hints at Formula One exit if calendar expands further,"The Formula One season is the longest it has ever been.
    

            In 2018, for the second time in three years, drivers and teams have competed over the course of a 21-race season, spending more time away from families and homes.
    

            Now, with the announcement of a Vietnamese Grand Prix being added to the calendar from 2020, Lewis Hamilton has expressed his concern that the season is becoming unbearably long.
    

            

    

            

    

            “I am not going to be here if it gets to 25 races, that’s for sure,” Hamilton told reporters. 
    

            “It already feels like we are on race 25 this year, so I don’t think that’s a good thing. I think 18 was probably the best back in the day.”
    

            Despite next year also featuring 21 races, the schedule in 2019 means the F1 calendar will run into December for the first time in over 50 years.
    

            Liberty Media, the company that has owned Formula One since January 2017, has often expressed its hopes of expanding the season further.
    

            “I’m someone who really loves racing but the season is long,” Hamilton said. “It’s a lot of commitment for all of us and a lot of time away from families, and the seasons are getting longer and the off time is getting shorter.
    

            “All I can do is speak is for myself. The turnaround is so short, you start preparing for your next season often as soon as the season is done. 
    

            “Getting your mind turned. That’s very difficult. Then you have to find a way of switching off and recovering at the same time.”
    

            Hamilton wrapped up his fifth world title in Mexico a fortnight ago but the constructors’ championship is still to be decided.
    

            Ferrari must better Mercedes’ score in Brazil this weekend by 13 points or more if they want the title race to go to the season finale in Abu Dhabi."
2014-08-22T09:19:10Z,Russian convoy rolls into Ukraine: ‘Humanitarian’ aid or ‘direct invasion’?,"White House: Obama, Merkel agree Russian convoy is ""a provocation""
UK ambassador: Convoy ""has nothing to do with humanitarianism""
Lithuania official: Consul kidnapped, killed by ""terrorists""
Putin blames Ukraine, says it'd be ""unacceptable"" to delay sending convoy

            Is it an act of compassion or one of belligerence? 
    

            Both judgments were offered Friday on the dozens of Russian trucks that have rolled into eastern Ukraine, a move Russian leaders cast as necessary to address a humanitarian crisis and a Ukrainian official characterized as an “invasion” of his nation by its mighty neighbor to the east.
    

            While getting agreement on the right answer is impossible at this moment, there’s little doubt the actions have raised tensions to new levels – and that’s saying something, given the volatility over the past many months.
    

            The latest row revolves around aid going from Russia to Ukraine. Kiev had stalled trucks on the Russian side of the border for days, before acknowledging Sunday that the convoy, in fact, had humanitarian aid.
    

            That admission didn’t end the discord and debate. As of 11:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) Friday, 227 Russian vehicles had crossed into Ukraine, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has an observer mission at the checkpoint the convoy went through.
    

            All the vehicles were supposed to be monitored by members of the International Committee of the Red Cross. However, the Red Cross said it wasn’t accompanying them due to the “volatile security situation” – a reference to continued fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of directly and indirectly bolstering the rebel movement. The Kiev-based government and its allies – including the NATO alliance and its core member, the United States – see this convoy as perhaps Moscow’s most glaring, egregious move yet.
    

            “We call this a direct invasion for the first time under cynical cover of the Red Cross,” said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine’s security service.
    

            Right now, Ukraine isn’t planning to go after the convoy. Still, Nalyvaychenko thinks its main purpose is to supply rebels and its drivers are not even civilians.
    

            To Russian President Vladimir Putin, it is Ukraine’s government – not his – that’s being irresponsible and fueling instability in eastern Ukraine. 
    

            Putin expressed “serious concern” to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about endangered civilians and other impacts from Ukraine’s “continued (military) escalation,” according to the Kremlin.
    

            He further criticized what he characterized as “Kiev’s blatant attempts to hinder the delivery of Russian humanitarian aid” into southeast Ukraine, implying he had no choice but to act.
    

            “Further delay would have been unacceptable,” a Kremlin statement said.
    

            

    

            The international community hardly embraced Putin’s version of events.
    

            The British ambassador to the United Nations said that Russia had no support at a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday on the topic. The diplomat, Mark Lyall Grant, made no doubt about his own country’s views on the convoy’s entrance into Ukraine.
    

            “It is an undeniable and blatant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and clear breach of international law and the U.N. charter,” Lyall Grant told reporters. “It has nothing to do with humanitarianism.”
    

            NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned that the the “so-called humanitarian convoy … can only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel.”
    

            “The disregard of international humanitarian principles raises further questions about whether the true purpose of the aid convoy is to support civilians or to resupply armed separatists,” Rasmussen said in a statement.       
    

            Merkel talked not only with Putin – during which she voiced her “grave concern” – but also with U.S. President Barack Obama.
    

            The two leaders agreed that Ukraine “has continued to deteriorate since the tragic downing” of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, purportedly by pro-Russian rebels, the White House said. The pair concurred, too, that the convoy “is a further provocation and a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty” and called for the stop “of Russian personnel, military equipment and armored vehicles into eastern Ukraine.”
    

            Other U.S. officials laid into Russia publicly.
    

            Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said that Moscow has been told in “very, very clear (terms) that they should not be doing this under the guise of a humanitarian convoy, to use that as an excuse to cross the border in a non-authorized way.”
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “Russia must remove its vehicles and its personnel from the territory of Ukraine immediately,” Kirby told reporters. “Failure to do so will result in additional costs and isolation.”
    

        Russia must remove its vehicles and its personnel from the territory of Ukraine immediately.
    

            Pentagon spokesman John Kirby
        

            This view was seconded by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, who deemed the convoy – which he said his nation and its allies are tracking closely – “as part of a pattern of flagrant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.” The more Moscow does such things that stir instability in Ukraine, the more it will pay, according to Rhodes.
    

            “If (Russia does) not remove the convoys, we will be making determinations with our international partners about how to ratchet up the costs and consequences on them,” Rhodes said.
    

            

    

            It’s not just the Russian vehicles that crossed into Ukraine that are causing consternation. So, too, are the Russian troops massed at the border.
    

            There were up to 18,000 such “combat-ready” troops on Friday, a significant increase from previous public estimates by the Pentagon, according to a U.S. defense official with direct access to the latest information. 
    

            The official described the units as being in a “fully combat-capable offensive posture.”
    

            A second U.S. official said that many of the units were positioned at “crossroads and towns” two to 10 miles from the border. 
    

            “They are definitely more overt, aggressive and out in the open,” the official said. “They aren’t even hiding it.”
    

            The second official said the United States has believed for weeks that some Russian troops have crossed the border as part of the convoys of military gear and weapons moving from Russia into Ukraine.
    

            Of particular concern is the apparent transport of long-range and advanced systems including at least two SA-22 surface-to-air missile system and a number of pieces of longer-range artillery.
    

            The fear is that any advance of any kind could make the ongoing fighting – sparked last year by a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia – even worse. U.N. officials estimate that more than 2,000 people have died and nearly 5,000 have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April.
    

            The dead include Mykola Zelenec, Lithuania’s honor consul in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk, who Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said had been “kidnapped and brutally killed by terrorists.”
    

            Ukraine has time and again accused Russia of effectively fomenting rebellion by supporting rebels – including militarily – in eastern Ukraine, some of whom continue to hold territory there despite a push by Ukraine’s military.
    

            Russia has denied any direct support for the rebels while voicing sympathy for their fight for self-determination, saying that Kiev is in the wrong for its actions that endanger civilians – including many ethnic Russians.
    

            Even if the Russian military doesn’t explicitly march into Ukraine, there are concerns that it will find other ways to bolster the rebels.
    

            Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, insisted Friday that the current humanitarian convoy won’t be one of them.
    

            He told reporters that Russia received “official acceptance by Kiev authorities” for the convoy, and that Moscow is staying in touch with Ukrainian officials to make sure there are no problems in the process of distribution of the aid.

2017-03-27T05:05:47Z,London’s Muslim women march for victims of Westminster terror attack,"Muslim women take to Westminster Bridge Sunday to publicly show horror over the attack
12th person arrested Sunday, Metropolitan Police say

            Muslim women linked arms along Westminster Bridge Sunday in a show of solidarity with the victims of last week’s London terror attack.
    

            The women, many of whom wore blue to symbolize peace, were joined by supporters who stood in silence for five minutes as Big Ben struck 4 p.m.
    

            Four days prior, lone attacker Khalid Masood rammed a car into pedestrians on the bridge, killing three and leaving dozens injured.
    

            He crashed the vehicle before later stabbing an on-duty police officer in the grounds of Parliament. 
    

            Masood was shot dead by police at the scene. A fourth victim died later in the week, when his life support was withdrawn.
    

            The vigil, which was organized by the Women’s March on London, came after a photo of a woman wearing an Islamic head covering crossing the bridge in the aftermath of the attack went viral on social media. 
    

            Some commentators criticized what they perceived to be the woman’s indifference to an injured victim in the image. 
    

            The woman in the photograph released a statement Friday to set the record straight.
    

      
      

      

    

            “Not only have I been devastated by witnessing the aftermath of a shocking and numbing terror attack, I’ve also had to deal with the shock of finding my picture plastered all over social media by those who could not look beyond my attire, who draw conclusions based on hate and xenophobia,” she 
, a UK-based organization which monitors anti-Muslim attacks.
    

            “My thoughts at that moment were one of sadness, fear, and concern,” the unnamed woman said in a statement. 
    

    

            “What the image does not show is that I had talked to other witnesses to try and find out what was happening, to see if I could be of any help… My thoughts go out to all the victims and their families.”
    

            The photographer who took the photo has spoken out in the woman’s defense. 
    

            “The people who took on that picture are being rather selective,” freelance photographer Jamie Lorriman 
. “In the other picture in the sequence, she looks truly distraught… personally I think she looks distressed in both pictures.”
    

            In all, twelve people were arrested in relation to the attack. The latest was a 30-year old man who was detained Sunday in Birmingham “on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts” under the TACT or Terrorism Act 2000, Metropolitan Police said.
    

            Nine people who had been arrested earlier have been released “with no further action.”
    

            A 58-year-old man who was arrested Thursday in Birmingham remains in custody. A 32-year-old woman, arrested in Manchester, is out on bail, pending further inquiries. 
    

            Investigators do not currently see a direct ISIS hand in last week’s attack in London, a British counterterrorism official told CNN on Saturday. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Khalid Masood was active on the encryption messaging service WhatsApp two minutes before he started his attack Wednesday on Westminster Bridge, but no evidence has emerged to show he was communicating with ISIS at any point, the official told CNN. 
    

            Investigators are looking into communications he had with individuals leading up to the attack 
, the official added. 
    

            Investigators are still assessing whether the attacker plotted alone or acted as part of a broader conspiracy. They’re continuing to probe his contacts in radical circles in Birmingham, Luton and London, the official told CNN. 
    

            Authorities are investigating how the perpetrator, who used multiple aliases, became radicalized. He was born Adrian Russell Ajao but also used the name Adrian Elms, police said Friday. 
    

            Born in Kent, Masood had previous convictions, including some for violent offenses, but none for terrorism, police said. His most recent conviction was in 2003 for possession of a knife.
    

      
      

      

    

            The Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia issued a statement Saturday saying Masood visited Saudi Arabia from November 2005 to November 2006 and from April 2008 to April 2009, when he worked as an English teacher. He also obtained a visa and visited Saudi Arabia from March 3 to 8, 2015, the statement said. 
    

            

    

            In addition to four deaths, this week’s attack
wounded at least 50 others, 31 of whom needed hospital treatment, Rowley said. Two people are in critical condition, and another has life-threatening injuries. 
    

            American tourist Kurt Cochran and college administrator Aysha Frade, a British citizen with Spanish roots, as well as Palmer died Wednesday. A fourth victim, Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Streatham in south London, died Thursday night after his life support was withdrawn, according to the Metropolitan Police.
    

            A fourth victim, Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Streatham in south London, died Thursday night after his life support was withdrawn, according to the Metropolitan Police.
    

            

    

            Cochran and his wife, Melissa, from Utah, were visiting London to 
 when they were hit by the car on the bridge. Melissa suffered a broken leg, a broken rib and a cut to her head.
    

            The couple ran a recording studio in West Bountiful, near Salt Lake City.
    

            The Metropolitan Police issued a statement from their family Monday in which they said Melissa’s health is improving. 
    

            “So many people have been so kind, and we are deeply touched by their goodness and generosity. Your notes, prayers, donations and love have helped us so much,” they said.
    

            “The most difficult part of all of this is that Kurt is no longer with us, and we miss him terribly. He was an amazing individual who loved everyone and tried to make the world a better place. He left a legacy of generosity and service that continues to inspire us. 
    

            “We are deeply saddened to lose him but are grateful that the world is coming to know him and be inspired by him.”

Phil Mickelson seeks first win after six runners-up spots

            Oakmont is a golf course without any water hazards, but that all changed as thunderstorms and torrential rain washed out most of the opening round of the 2016 U.S. Open.
    

            The revered track outside Pittsburgh became waterlogged as storms caused three separate weather delays before play was called off for the day.
    

            

    

            Only nine players finished their first round and more than half the field were yet to start, leaving American qualifier Andrew Landry, the world No. 624, top of the leaderboard.
    

            The 28-year-old was three under par playing the final hole, one shot clear of world No. 4 Bubba Watson and Danny Lee, when the hooter went for the final time at 1551 ET on Friday.
    
No more ⛳️ for today. 
 

            American amateur Scottie Scheffler shot 69 to finish one under alongside Kevin Streelman, Lee Westwood and Harris English. 
    

            Defending champion Jordan Spieth was one over after 11, with third-ranked 2011 winner Rory McIlroy four over alongside Masters champion Danny Willett. 
    

            World No. 5 Rickie Fowler had a difficult day and was six over after 12 at the end.

            During the first delay, several players, including England’s Westwood and Luke Donald and Germany’s Martin Kaymer, sought refuge in the media center to watch 
 in the Euro 2016 soccer tournament. 
    

            “It’s obviously a frustrating day having to keep coming off, but there’s nothing you can do about the weather,” said Westwood, who eagled the par-four 14th.

            Among those still to start was Phil Mickelson, celebrating his 46th birthday, who is seeking a first U.S. Open title after a record six runner-up spots. 
    

            

    

            Victory in his national championship would make the popular left-hander  the sixth player to win the career grand slam of all four major titles.  
    

            Only Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods have achieved the feat, and Mickelson admitted earlier this week it plays on his mind.
    

            “This is the tournament I want to win most to complete the four majors,” the American told reporters. “I think about it all the time.
    

            “I have to put that out of my head, be patient and not think about results.”
    

            Mickelson, who won the last of his five major titles at the British Open in 2013, added: “I’m excited. I view this week as a great opportunity to complete something that would be historic in my mind.”
    

            

    

            The Californian came into the tournament under something of a cloud after agreeing to return almost $1m he made in profit from an insider trading tip.
    

            “After a multiple-year investigation which led to nothing, no charges or anything, I think that kind of says enough for me,” he said.
    

            World No.1 Jason Day was also still to tee off but likes his chances at a course he says “almost feels like home”, given his agent lives nearby.
    

            

    

            “This is one tournament that is very stressful and I feel like I thrive under stress, and hopefully I can do that this year,” said the Australian who won the U.S. PGA  last year for his maiden major title.
    

            The first round will resume on Saturday morning at Oakmont as organizers hope to get back on track to avoid a Monday finish.
    

            Ironically, the U.S. Open is the only major to retain an 18-hole Monday playoff, so further lengthy delays could extend play into Tuesday."

            In an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Times, Wallace said al Qaeda –  the group behind the infamous World Trade Center attacks that killed almost 3,000 people in the US on September 11, 2001 – “still aspire for aviation attacks” and is developing technology to bring down planes.
    

            “The aviation threat is real,” Wallace said in the interview on Saturday night. “(Al Qaeda) have reorganized. They are pushing more and more plots towards Europe and have become familiar with the new methods.”
    

      
      

      

    

            The rise of ISIS has overshadowed the al Qaeda threat in recent years – particularly after its most prominent leader, Osama Bin Laden, was killed by US forces in Pakistan in 2011.
    

            But Wallace said the danger had never truly diminished.
    

            “Al Qaeda sat quietly in the corner and tried to work out what the 21st century looked like while ISIS became the latest terrorist boy band,” he said. “But they have not gone away.”
    

            British intelligence chiefs are also concerned about US President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, with Wallace saying it will create a “new safe haven for Islamists to launch attacks on the West.”
    

            His remarks echo concerns voiced by US politicians, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, who told Trump in the past week that withdrawing troops from the Middle East 

    

            Wallace’s statements come amid widespread chaos at Gatwick Airport in the UK over the weekend as rogue drones flying overhead led dozens of flights to be canceled.

2017-12-11T13:22:03Z,England’s Football Association probes Manchester Derby fracas,"Reported fracas following Manchester Derby
Manchester City beat Manchester United 2-1
City's Premier League lead is now 11 points

            England’s Football Association has asked Manchester United and Manchester City for their “observations” over a fracas involving players and coaches from both teams following Sunday’s key Premier League game.
    

            City coach Mikel Arteta was widely reportedly to have suffered a cut to the head in the melee that involved up to 20 players and members of staff of the two teams. 
    

            Britain’s Press Association reported United boss Jose Mourinho was embroiled in a “heated exchange” with City players after his side were beaten 2-1 by the Premier League leaders.
    

            United were unhappy about City’s whooping and cheering following a win that extended their league lead over second-place United to 11 points.
    

            Neither club has commented on the incident and have not responded to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            Greater Manchester Police told CNN it hadn’t been contacted by either club or any individual over the bust-up.
    
Amazing game. Such a big performance from everyone. We go again next week 
 
 

            

    

            Mourinho had water thrown at him and the Press Association reported that United’s manager was involved in a “confrontation” with City goalkeeper Ederson.
    

            Usually at Old Trafford one police officer is always positioned outside the referee’s dressing room, which is very close to the visiting team’s locker room.
    

            Both clubs were asked to respond by December 13, before the FA extended the deadline to December 15 by 6pm.
    

            David Silva gave City the lead before Marcus Rashford equalized just before halftime, but Nicolas Otamendi grabbed a second-half winner after capitalizing on Romelu Lukaku’s error. 
    

            Mourinho was particularly unhappy that referee Michael Oliver booked United midfielder Ander Herrera for diving after a challenge by Otamendi, rather than giving the home team a penalty.
    

            “It is a huge penalty in a crucial moment of the game,” Mourinho told reporters.
    

            City boss Pep Guardiola said: “We won because we were better, in all departments.”
    

            

    

            It’s not the first time that there has been a post-match melee at Old Trafford.
    

            In October 2004, then United manager  Alex Ferguson was hit by pizza thrown by then Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas in an incident dubbed “The Battle of the Buffet.”"
2023-04-27T09:05:52Z,New Houston Rockets head coach Ime Udoka reflects on ‘poor decision’ that led to Boston Celtics departure,"addressed the “poor decision” that led to his departure from the 
as he was announced as the Houston Rockets’ new head coach Wednesday.
    

            In September, Boston suspended Udoka for the entire 2022/23 season for violating team policies, following an investigation into his conduct by an independent law firm. According to ESPN, The Athletic and the Boston Globe, Udoka had a consensual relationship with a female member of the team’s staff.
    

      
      

      

    

            Udoka was let go by Boston in February after the Celtics removed the interim tag off current Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla. 
    

            “I released a statement months ago when everything happened and apologized to a lot of people for the tough position I put them in,” Udoka told reporters. “I stand by that, and I feel much more remorse even now.”
    

            The 45-year-old said he spent time working on himself by going to counseling with his son and taking sensitivity training.
    

            “Having that time off and really a full understanding of how many people you impact by a poor decision, that’s where you start with the ownership and accountability,” Udoka said. 
    

            “I preach that to the players and so I have to take responsibility for my part in it. (I) took leadership and sensitivity training and some counseling with my son to help him improve the situation that I put him in.”
    

            On whether the Celtics were justified in the actions they took against him, Udoka said: “They had a choice to make a decision and they went that route. My thing was own up to it, take responsibility and I served the suspension …  It was their right to go about it however they wanted to.”
    

            Rockets governor Tilman Fertitta said he felt comfortable hiring Udoka after speaking with the league.
    

            “The NBA told me that they felt very comfortable with Ime becoming the coach of the Houston Rockets and so that made me feel really good after a lengthy, lengthy conversation with them.”
    

            In his lone season (2021/22) at the helm in Boston, Udoka guided the Celtics to a 51-31 record and an NBA Finals appearance in which they lost to the Golden State Warriors. The season prior to his arrival, the Celtics finished 36-36.
    

            Udoka inherits a Rockets team that finished the year 22-60, tied for the worst record in the Western Conference with another Texas team, the San Antonio Spurs."
2021-01-20T10:42:13Z,Novak Djokovic says ‘good intentions’ were ‘misconstrued’ following backlash to list of proposals,"Novak Djokovic says his “good” intentions were “misconstrued” after a 
he sent to Craig Tiley, the CEO of Tennis Australia, prompted a backlash from sections of the public.
    

            The Serb’s suggestions would have loosened the restrictions on the quarantining tennis players ahead of next month’s Australian Open and make their acclimation to playing on a court easier once the self-isolation periods are over.
    

            These included fitness and training equipment in every room, food that meets the standard of that served at the Australian Open, reducing the number of days the players are required to quarantine for, permission to visit coaches providing both have returned negative Covid-19 tests and moving as many players as possible to private houses with tennis courts.
    

            Currently, 72 players are in isolation after three separate charter flights into Melbourne last week each had passengers that tested positive for Covid-19, meaning everyone on board the three aircraft had to isolate on arrival.
    

            Djokovic’s requests were flatly denied by the Victoria Premier, Daniel Andrews.
    

            “My good intentions to my fellow competitors in Melbourne have been misconstrued as being selfish, difficult and ungrateful,” the eight-time Australian Open champion said in a statement on Twitter. “This couldn’t be father from the truth. 
    

            “I genuinely care about my fellow players and I also understand very well how the world is run and who gets bigger and better and why. I’ve earned my privileges the hard way and for that reason, it is very difficult for me to be a mere onlooker knowing how much every help, gesture and good word mattered to me when I was small and insignificant in the world pecking order. 
    

            “Hence, I use my position of privilege to be of service as much as I can where and when needed. “There were a few suggestions and ideas that I gathered from other players from our chat group and there was no harm intended to try and help.”
    

            As she adjusts to life quarantining ahead of the Australian Open, tennis star 
 has revealed she is mourning the death of her grandfather, less than a week after announcing that her grandmother and aunt had passed away due to Covid-19.
    

            The 
 is currently undergoing a strict 14-day quarantine at a Melbourne hotel ahead of next month’s grand slam.
    

            In a social media post last week, Stephens revealed her Auntie Anna had passed away on December 26 and her grandmother on January 10.
    

            “I’ve watched this video from NY about 100 times today,” she wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, accompanied by a clip of her speaking to her grandfather over the phone following her US Open triumph. “My grandpa has gone to be with the Lord and the love of his life. One week apart from my grandma. Losing her was too much for his heart.
    

            “My grandpa was the kindest soul and I will miss him forever. I can only hope to fill so many lives with the love and happiness he did. He is the definition of love, kindness, generosity and a true example of family.
    

            “All I ever wanted to do was to make my grandparents proud! I’m most proud they got to witness my tennis dreams come true & become a reality. I’m thankful for the time I had with both of them & grateful that I can see so much of them both in my mother, who continues to be my rock. Stories will be told of their great love. May they rest together in eternal peace.”
    

            Stephens is one of 72 players set to compete at the Australian Open currently undergoing a strict hotel quarantine period.
    

            On Wednesday, Victoria’s Police Minister, Lisa Neville, announced that a further three people – two of which are players – set to attend the Australian Open had tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total number to 10.
    

            Neville said authorities were “very confident” one of the two new player infections was a case of viral shedding. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “One of those is a player who we absolutely believe is shedding, but has anyway been in hard lockdown because he came in on one of the flights where we had positives,” Neville said. “One is another player. One is a support person with that player.
    

            “In the meantime, the player, the support person and their bubble so the other support person and player they’re with will not be training until we have a final confirmation that they are shedding or that they are positive. If they are positive, those two will go onto a health hotel and the two bubble people will be considered close contacts and will be in lockdown for the 14 days.”
    

            Viral shedding is the release of the virus from the body into the environment and can occur even if a person has tested negative for Covid-19.
    

            Players currently stuck in quarantine have been getting creative with ways to practice while confined to their hotel rooms, with some resorting to using their beds as makeshift hitting partners.
    

            However, normally accustomed to practicing on a court for several hours a day in the lead up to a grand slam, some players have suggested those who underwent quarantine will be at a physical disadvantage when the Australian Open starts on February 8.
    

            Daniel Vallverdu, coach of three-time grand slam winner Stan Wawrinka, has proposed that the players who were stuck in their hotel rooms should receive preferential treatment when the tournament begins, including more practice time and matches at cooler times of the day. 
    
Rule 1 of quarantine : no contact 🚷☕️🍳🥑✅🇦🇺🙏🏻 
 
 
 
 

            “Anything we can do to make it a bit more fair for them, it’s never going to be completely fair,” 
.  “Once they come out of quarantine they’re only going to have one or two days maximum to get on court before having their first match.
    

            “So any extra days that they can get, and preference and some privileges when it comes to scheduling, I think would be more than fair and hopefully the rest of the playing field will feel the same. Scheduling, extra practice, preferential treatment when it comes to practice times, extra time on the court.
    

            “Match scheduling, playing not in the sunny time of the day, they can play when it cools down a bit, they can get a late start for the tournament, the tournament can start one or two days later if possible.”"
2023-03-12T07:15:38Z,Fox hunting club that first met in the 1700s holds last meet after new law,"One of Scotland’s oldest fox hunts has come to an end after 252 years following the introduction of new law on hunting.
    

            The Hunting with Dogs bill, which went into effect earlier this week after being passed in January, outlaws hunting and killing wild mammals using packs of dogs except in limited circumstances.
    

            Following its introduction, the Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire Hunt – which first met in the 1700s – announced it had held its final meet.
    

            “We were humbled to see the huge support by riders and supporters for our modest hunt in the west of Scotland,” the group wrote on Facebook, also thanking “all farmers and landowners who have allowed us to cross your land in some tricky weather over the years.” 
    

            “A big thank you to every single person who has helped out in any way over the years, big or small, it is all very much appreciated,” it said. 
    

            “Finally we wish to thank our lovely hounds, we look after them with great love and affection, often better than we do ourselves.” 
    

            Originating in the sixteenth century, fox hunting remains a controversial topic in the United Kingdom. 
    

            Hunters view it as an important part of local heritage while animal rights activists argue that it is cruel and unnecessary. 
    

            Anti-hunting organizations have previously welcomed the bill’s implementation. 
    

            “This historic news is a huge win for wildlife, locals against the hunt and of course hunt saboteurs who have spent decades bringing this hunt to their knees,” the Glasgow Hunt Sabs said on its website."
2013-06-02T17:00:34Z,Champion Lorenzo claims Italian treble,"World motorcycling champion Jorge Lorenzo wins at Mugello for third successive year
He closes gap on fellow Spaniard Dani Pedrosa, who repeats last year's second place
Pedrosa's Honda teammate Marc Marquez misses out on history after crashing
Lorenzo's Yamaha teammate Valentino Rossi was an early casualty at his home track

            Jorge Lorenza kickstarted his MotoGP title defense on Sunday as he won the Italian Grand Prix for the third year in a row.
    

            The Spanish motorcyclist overtook pole sitter Dani Pedrosa at the first corner at Mugello and never surrendered the lead as he trimmed his rival’s championship advantage to 12 points after five races. 
    

            “I knew it was going to be a really hard race because it got much hotter than it had been in the morning,” Lorenzo told the MotoGP website. 
    

            “Dani was following me for about 13 laps, but on the 13th I pushed a little bit more – to be about three-tenths faster – and it seems he gave up a little bit, so it was much easier from then.”
    

            Pedrosa had to fight off his rookie Honda teammate Marc Marquez, who dropped to third in the standings after suffering another one of the crashes that had marred his practice and qualifying sessions – and this time ended his race.
    

            

    

      
      

      

    

            Pedrosa claimed second place ahead of Britain’s Cal Crutchlow, with German rider Stefan Bradl fourth to match his best career result.
    

            “I didn’t feel fully comfortable in the race today, but I’m happy because I was able to gain a large number of points,” said Pedrosa, who had won the two previous races in his native Spain and France, and was second at Mugello last year.
    

            “In general, this was a difficult weekend. The back tire was giving me a lot of problems with grip but taking 20 points from this race and maintaining the lead the World Championship is something positive.”
    

            Marquez had been aiming to become the first newcomer to finish on the podium in the first five races of a season, but he suffered his seventh crash since stepping up to motorcycling’s elite division.
    

            

    

            “After three difficult days of setbacks and hard work, I finally felt good during the race,” said the 20-year-old, who dropped 26 points behind Pedrosa.
    

            “I don’t fully understand why I crashed, as I lost both the front and the back at the same time and was unable to save it. It’s clear that we made a mistake, but we can’t go looking for excuses.
    

            “We can’t forget that this is my first year in the class and I am here to learn how things are in MotoGP. In spite of everything we were still fighting for second place, which is a reason to be happy.”
    

            Lorenzo’s Yamaha teammate Valentino Rossi was another casualty, with Italy’s seven-time world champion retiring only three corners into the race after being hit by Alvaro Bautista.
    

            Rossi’s previous team Ducati gave the home fans something to cheer as Andrea Dovizioso, Nicky Hayden and Michele Pirro were fifth, sixth and seventh respectively.

2021-07-09T12:43:35Z,Lionel Messi faces old friend Neymar in last bid for Copa America glory with Argentina,"When 
steps out onto the pitch for Saturday’s Copa America final, it could be his last chance to win a trophy with Argentina.
    

            Standing in his way, as he attempts to end his country’s 28-year trophy drought, will be a familiar face in former Barcelona teammate Neymar.
    

            Brazil is the current defending champion and boasts the formidable record of having won every previous edition played on home soil – this year’s tournament was also moved to Brazil just 13 days before kick-off after co-hosts Colombia and Argentina were stripped of hosting rights.
    

            Few would expect an underwhelming Argentina side to go far at next year’s World Cup in Qatar and Messi will be 37 the next time the Copa America comes around in 2024.
    

            Widely considered one of the greatest players of all time, 
 relationship with the Argentine national team and its fans has been fraught at times.
    

            In the past, after some fairly lackluster performances, he has been accused by some of caring more about Barcelona than Argentina, something Messi has always strongly denied.
    

            

    

            Over the years, however, he has gone on to become a revered figure in his homeland.
    

    

            That was never more obvious than when Messi announced his retirement following defeat in the 2016 Copa America final – the second year in a row Argentina had lost to Chile on penalties – and the entire country united in a successful attempt to convince him to pull on the blue and white shirt again.
    

            At times, Messi has single-handedly carried the national team over the years, notably during qualification process to the 2018 World Cup, during which Argentina flirted with the possibility of failing to reach the finals.
    

            During the semifinal penalty shootout win over Colombia, Messi – who has four goals and five assists in this Copa America – once again showed the type of leader he has become for Argentina.
    

            National broadcaster TyC Sport featured a ‘Messi-Cam’ during the shootout, which was focused on the Argentine captain the entire time. It showed his intense reaction to each penalty Argentina scored, while he was also the first to console Rodrigo De Paul after his miss.
    

            

    

            However, it was his reaction to Yerry Mina’s miss that generated the biggest reaction on social media. 
    

            The Colombia defender has become known for his somewhat over the top celebrations after scoring in shootouts and after his penalty was saved by Emiliano Martinez, Messi could be seen shouting “dance now” at Mina during his entire walk back to the center circle.
    

            Messi exuberance was a stark contrast to the last time he featured in a penalty shootout for Argentina. After missing his penalty in the final against Chile in 2016, Messi was doubled over on the turf and appeared to be close to vomiting.
    

            Martinez was unquestionably the hero of Wednesday’s tie, saving three of Colombia’s penalties and the Aston Villa goalkeeper was mobbed by Messi and his teammates.
    

            Saturday’s showpiece will be the first time since 2007 that Brazil and Argentina have faced off in a Copa America final, incidentally Messi’s first with the national team.
    

            There will be 5,500 spectators at the iconic Maracana stadium to watch it, the first time fans will be able to attend matches this tournament. 
    

            The attendees will have to show a negative Covid-19 PCR test, wear masks, and maintain two meters distance from while inside.
    

            Brazil will be hoping for a repeat of that comfortable 3-0 win and go into this match as the favorite.
    

            Under head coach Tite, Brazil is a long way from playing the ‘beautiful football’ of old, but this side is pragmatic and dogged, a style that has brought considerable success over the past five years.
    

            That culminated in victory at the 2019 Copa America, the country’s first piece of major silverware since 2007.
    

            Brazil has never quite clicked into top gear during this tournament, but has found success built on a stingy defense; the team has conceded just two goals all tournament and none so far in the knockout stages.
    

            Even when down to 10 men for the entire second half in the quarterfinal against Chile, Brazil never looked like conceding a goal.
    

            Neymar’s legacy with the Brazilian national team is already guaranteed to be one of glory. Not only has he led the team to Olympic and Copa America glory on home soil, he will more than likely finish his career’s as Brazil’s greatest ever goalscorer, currently just nine goals behind Pele.
    

            Should Messi lead Argentina to glory, however, it would certainly alter his legacy entirely.

            British police investigating the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann will begin digging this week in an area of wasteland close to where she went missing in Portugal, sources close to the investigation have told CNN.
    

            Media have gathered outside a cordoned-off area of the beach resort town of Praia da Luz, in Portugal’s Algarve region, but it is unclear when digging will begin.
    

            Madeleine was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family’s holiday apartment on May 3, 2007.
    

            Her parents had left Madeleine and her younger twin siblings asleep while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Her mother raised the alarm when she checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            CNN understands that London’s Metropolitan Police will be in charge of the new digging operation in abandoned terrain close to where Madeleine disappeared. A large investigation team is expected to use dogs and radar in the search and dig a number of holes, sources said.
    

            Portuguese police searched the area soon after Madeleine’s disappearance, and it is understood they will intervene only if a body is found.
    

            Sources told CNN that British police were working on the assumption that Madeleine was dead, while their Portuguese counterparts were working on the assumption that she was still alive and had been taken out of Portugal by a non-Portuguese national who had been in the country for a short time.
    

            Scotland Yard – as London’s Metropolitan Police are known – has not commented on the latest development, other than to confirm that British officers would be in Praia da Luz this week.
    

            On May 22, its head of specialist crime and operations,

            “It should not be assumed that this substantial upcoming phase of work in Portugal will immediately lead us to the answers that will explain what has happened,” he warned. “What you will see is normal police activity you would expect in any such major investigation.”
    

            Rowley said the senior investigator in the case, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, and his team would be traveling to Portugal but would not be commenting on the investigation.
    

            He reiterated that Portuguese police had advised Metropolitan Police that they did not brief media on current investigations.
    

            “They clearly stated that if the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) provide any briefings or information on the work they are undertaking on our behalf, or if reporters cause any disruption to their work in Portugal, activity will cease until that problem dissipates,” Rowley said.
    

            “We have made it clear to colleagues in Portugal that we will not be giving operational updates,” he said. “If media interfere with police work, that work will stop.”

Premier League side beat off competition from third-tier team Leyton Orient
Reconstruction work on the arena expected to cost between $210-240 million
U.S. president's favorite English team will contribute $24 million

            Barack Obama received the backing of a nation when he was elected for a second term as U.S. president last month, and now his favorite English soccer club has also won a significant ballot.
    

            English Premier League side West Ham United – the team of choice of the 44th president of the United States – has been selected as the preferred occupant for London’s Olympic Stadium, the venue which hosted the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
    

            The London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) announced on Wednesday that the east London club – whose stadium is located near to the former Olympic Park site in Stratford – had beaten off competition from neighboring third-tier team Leyton Orient, a proposed sports university project and a consortium looking to bring Formula One to the British capital.
    

            

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “The LLDC’s board unanimously agreed that West Ham United’s bid for a concession to play at the Olympic Stadium should be ranked highest of the bids received, and that negotiations should be held with the club on final commercial terms for them to move to the stadium,” read a statement on the organization’s website.
    

            West Ham had initially tried to buy the stadium and was named the preferred bidder in February 2011, but that deal collapsed in October of that year after threats of court action from rival candidates and an independent review of the process.
    

            The stadium was then offered to potential tenants, and from an initial 16 interested parties the list was cut to four bidders in March 2012.
    

            Despite backing West Ham’s bid for the 80,000-seater arena, the LLDC insisted any future tenant would have to accommodate the 2017 World Athletics Championships.
    

            If West Ham cannot cater for track and field, the club would be unable to complete its proposed move to the site.
    

            “If a football use can be agreed the stadium would be reconfigured to provide a retractable/moveable seating solution so there could be a quick change over between athletics and football use,” the LLDC said.
    

            “The legacy corporation recognizes that West Ham and other parties may not be able to meet the necessary conditions, so is progressing a detailed design for a non-football option.  This would allow the stadium to be brought back into use as soon as possible.”
    

            West Ham’s joint chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold hailed Wednesday’s announcement as the latest step in realizing the vision they had for the club when they purchased a 50% shareholding for $85 million in 2010.
    

            “We are ambitious for our great club and aim to set the benchmark for visiting away and neutral football supporters from across the globe to come and enjoy the iconic Stadium and be part of our Premier League club experience,” they said in a statement.
    

            Reconstruction work on the stadium, including extending the roof and adding retractable seating, will reportedly cost between $210-240 million and will be funded by a mix of public money and a $64 million loan from the local Newham Council.
    

            West Ham is expected to contribute $24 million to the restructuring of the public-funded stadium, which cost $690 million to build.
    

            The club returned to the English top flight in August following relegation in 2011, and has made an encouraging start to the season under the guidance of manager Sam Allardyce, sitting eighth in the table with 22 points from 15 matches.
    

            Obama has reportedly been a fan of “the Hammers” since a trip to England several years before his election to office in 2008.
    

            The club’s supporters have even sung songs in his honor during matches,"
2015-12-24T20:37:02Z,Space station plays Santa’s sleigh for kids in UK,"British weather service tells parents and kids to look to the sky on Christmas Eve
The International Space Station overflew the UK early Thursday evening, making like Santa
Britons take to social media: ""magic is unreal"" ... ""my daughter waving"" 

            Good boys and girls – and their kids – watched Santa’s sleigh (better known to grownups as the International Space Station) fly over the United Kingdom on Christmas Eve, thanks in part to a timely tip from the nation’s weather service.
    

            “As excited children everywhere wait with anticipation for Father Christmas, why not take a look up into the night sky on Christmas Eve and see if you can spot him, (or rather, the ISS),” the Met Office wrote in a statement on their website days before Thursday’s much-anticipated appearance. 
    

            The weather service said earlier this week that children looking up at the sky would be thrilled to see the bright light of the space station as St. Nick himself speeding past on his journey around the world.
    

            Indeed, they kept their Christmas promise.
    

            Eager parents took to social media to share the joy of this Christmas miracle, (or, prescheduled orbit, for the Grinches among us) at around 5:30 p.m. (12:30 p.m. ET).
    

            “Took caleb outside to see santa crossin the sky (aka space station) the magic is unreal! @NASA thanks for letting me know #magic #nasa #love,” one Mom wrote on Twitter.
    

            NASA had also posted times and coordinates where Christmas revelers could 
 in London, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and other cities. The timely flyover was more visible in the south of the country where forecasters predicted clear weather conditions. 
    

            “@spacegovuk @esa @Space_Station a brief viewing tonight. My daughter waving at the ISS shouting “Santa” Merry Christmas to the ISS crew.”
    

            One dad tweeted one small problem to astronaut Tim Peake, one of six crew members currently aboard the station:
    

            “@mattyjc @astro_timpeake problem with my kids. They’re both space station fans. 
    

            Dad: “That’s Santa”
    

            Kids: “Don’t be silly, that’s Tim in ISS.” 
    

            The International Space Station was built in collaboration by 16 countries and has been continuously crewed since 2000, when the first NASA astronauts arrived on an expedition. 
    

            It weighs nearly 1 million pounds and is about the size of a football field. It has as much pressurized living and working space as a Boeing 747 passenger jet. The station circles the Earth every 90 minutes, giving those on board a spectacular sunrise or sunset every 45 minutes.
    

            Three of the current crew members posted a holiday message on YouTube earlier this month.
    

            “Christmas is generally a time for friends and families to get together, and although we can’t be with our families this year, we will be orbiting the Earth 16 times on Christmas Day and sending all our good wishes to everybody back down on beautiful planet Earth,” 

    

            The three astronauts then rolled into a synchronized somersault – Christmas cheer delivered from zero gravity."

            Here are the details for how you can catch the big fight.
    

      
      

      

    

            Edwards and Usman will go head to head at London’s 02 Arena on Saturday, which has the second-highest seating capacity of any indoor venue in the United Kingdom.
    

            The early prelims were slated to start at 12:30 pm EDT, followed by the prelims at 3:00 pm and the main card at 5:00 pm. 
    

            The primary draw for the tournament is the main card battle between Edwards, the current UFC Welterweight Champion, and Usman, the former champion. Usman won a 2015 match against Edwards in his official debut as a UFC athlete, but lost to Edwards during a 2022 rematch. 
    

            But there are other exciting matches on the main card, including Rafael Fiziev vs. Justin Gaethje, Bryan Barberena vs. Gunnar Nelson, Casey O’Neill vs. Jennifer Maia, and Roman Dolidze vs. Marvin Vettori.

 on Thursday, after beating 
 2-1 in front of more than 15,000 fans. 
    

            The game, held in Budapest’s Puskas Arena, was the first major UEFA final to be held in front of spectators since the pandemic forced fixtures behind closed doors. 
    

            European football’s governing body treated the event as a pilot to bring fans back to stadiums, with both teams being allocated 3,000 tickets with the remainder taken up by locals. 
    

            Those in attendance watched an intriguing encounter between last season’s Champions League and Europa League winners, with the Bundesliga club coming out on top. 
    

            “We all know it is not easy to take the right decision,” Bayern manager Hansi Flick told reporters when asked about the presence of fans. 
    

            “It felt good to have an atmosphere in the stadium. It felt a bit more like football. I hope all the fans return home healthy.”
    

            

    

            Bayern needed extra-time to get the job done with Javi Martinez heading a 104th-minute winner in what could be his last game for the club. 
    

            Working tirelessly against the most in-form team in Europe, Sevilla had initially taken the lead after Lucas Ocampos’ audacious ‘no-look’ penalty before Leon Goretzka leveled the scores in the second half. 
    

            The hard-fought win secured an impressive quadruple for Bayern in 2020, adding to the three trophies it won last season – the Bundesliga, the German Cup and the Champions League. 
    

            Bayern is now unbeaten in 32 consecutive matches and has become the first team in Europe’s top five leagues to win 23 consecutive matches in all competitions. 
    

            It won its last league match 8-0 against Schalke. 
    

            “It was an intense game but we deserved to win,” Flick told reporters after the Super Cup victory. 
    

            “We are not yet fully in our rhythm despite our big win (8-0) over Schalke 04 on the weekend.
    

            “But the mentality of the team, especially after going 1-0 down, was sensational. They battled back against very strong opponents and deserved the win.”
    

            

    

            The sight of fans watching live football will be a welcome return for many but there had been much criticism over the decision to allow thousands to attend. 
    

            Europe is currently facing a second wave of Covid-19 infections, stoking fears the game could cause a further rise in cases.
    

      
      

      

    

            According to the World Health Organization, there have been 20,450 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Hungary and 702 deaths, but like much of Europe, the country faces a second wave of cases with more than 6,000 infections recorded last week.
    

            Those in attendance on Thursday had to abide by social distancing measures, such as remaining one-and-a-half meters apart, wearing face masks and undergoing a body temperature check on entry.
    

            “The measures are strict and there is not a question of health risks for the fans,” UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said in a press conference before the game.
    

            “We want – and health is the number one priority – to bring hope, to do what we think is the proper thing to do.
    

            “Don’t think we are doing this because of money because we don’t get any revenue, we get more costs with it. But fans and players are [an] essential part of football.”
    

            However, photos from the match show not all fans adhered to the restrictions, with groups seen celebrating close together without face coverings."

Host nation is aiming to clinch its second consecutive title 
Serbia won men's Davis Cup in 2010 and women are desperate to emulate them
Lucie Safarova will face  Ana Ivanovic in the first rubber in front of a sell-out crowd

            Two years might have passed since Serbia’s men triumphed in the Davis Cup – but the nation’s women are now ready to etch their name into tennis folklore.
    

            When Ana Ivanovic begins her match against Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic in Prague on Saturday, she will begin her country’s challenge against the reigning champion.
    

            The team of Ivanovic, Jelena Jankovic, Bojana Jovanovski and Aleksandra Krunic are desperate to pull off a repeat performance of the

            In their way stand a Czech team hoping to secure its second consecutive title following a 3-2 win over Russia last year.
    

            But Ivanovic, ranked 12th in the world, says the inspiration of events in Belgrade on that fateful night will act as a motivating factor.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            

    

            “I remember a couple of years ago,” Ivanovic told reporters.
    

            “I was there when they [the Serbian Davis Cup team] were winning and it was epic. We will try our best and to match what the guys did would be amazing.”
    

            Serbia has never won the Fed Cup and so the opportunity of being the first women from the country to land the honour is a huge lure for the team.
    

            “It’s an historical moment for Serbian women’s tennis,” Jankovic told the tournament’s official website.
    

            “We are all excited to be here in Prague and to have this opportunity to win the title, which is our ultimate goal and we very much look forward to the competition.
    

            “Winning Fed Cup would be a very special feeling. It’s difficult to compare it to your individual tournaments when you are lifting trophies because you are basically there on your own and here you can celebrate with your team.
    

            “For me, personally, the inspiration is the Serbian people and I always feel an obligation to give more than 100 per cent. Winning the title would be an amazing achievement.”
    

            

    

            A sell-out crowd of 13,800 is expected after tickets for the final sold out in less than six hours with Petra Kvitova’s father, Jiri, buying 100 for his friends and family.

            “I don’t think that we have a pressure because we are the defending champions,” she told the competition’s official website.
    

             “I think it’s because we are playing at home, it’s a full stadium and 14,000 people will come to support us. I’m looking forward to the tie for every minute.”

            “In the second and third set I just played the best tennis of my life,” Janowicz told the ATP website.
    

            

    

             “I didn’t know actually I can play that good. It’s really not easy for me to realise what is going on in my life right now. 
    

            “Right now I’m playing the best tennis of my life, and I hope tomorrow I can play even better. 
    

            “I don’t know what I should expect from myself, but I hope I will not finish tomorrow this tournament yet.”

            The Spaniard, seeded fourth, will now play home favourite Michael Llodra for a place in the final.

            Pence, who has been vocal in his criticism of North Korea in the run-up to the Games, sat just feet away. Asked by CNN if there was any concern by Pence about Kim’s sister sitting behind him, an aide to the vice president said, “not in the slightest.” 
    

      
      

      

    

            “He participated in a trilateral with (South Korean President Moon Jae-in) and (Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe) prior in a show of solidarity and then was thrilled to cheer on Team USA at the opening ceremony.”
    

            The aide noted that Pence “and our team were aware she’d be in attendance. A primary purpose of the trip was to show a united front with our allies in Japan and South Korea in support of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. The VP sat with Moon and Abe in the box after days of meetings with both leaders.”
    

            Kim Yo Jong is the first member of the North’s ruling dynasty to visit the south since the end of the Korean War in 1953. 
    

      
      

      

    

            The presence of Kim, who was promoted to the country’s Politburo, the senior body of North Korea’s communist party, as an alternate member last year, represents a hugely significant move in the thawing of relations between the North and South. Such a high-level meeting would have been unimaginable even a few months ago, but Moon sees the Winter Olympics as a chance to make diplomatic inroads with the North."

            The party said the attack happened “following numerous death threats as a result of her activism.”  
    

            London’s Metropolitan Police responded to reports of gunfire in southeast London about 3 a.m. local time Sunday morning, it said in a statement. 
    

            Police said paramedics transported a 27-year-old woman with gunshot wounds to a south London hospital, and that the incident appeared to have happened near a house party in Southwark.
    

            The police statement said that at this early stage of investigation there was no evidence to suggest a targeted attack or that the woman “had received any credible threats against her prior to this incident.”
    

            Detectives from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command (Trident) are conducting an investigation and looking to speak with anyone who was at the party in the Consort Road area of London, it added.
    

            “A dedicated team of detectives is working tirelessly to identify the person or persons responsible for this shooting,” said Detective Chief Inspector Jim Tele. He added that “they need the public’s help,” and urged people to come forward if they witnessed or had heard information about the incident.
    

            Tele added that while he recognized the incident “will have shocked those in the local community and further afield” he called on the public to “avoid speculating as to the motive or the circumstances behind it.” 
    

      
      

      

    

            Johnson rose to prominence last year during the Black Lives Matter protests, as a leader of the TTIP, which has been called “Britain’s first Black-led political party.”   
    

            She is a mother of three, and also works to deliver food and groceries to families in need, according to the party, which called her “a strong, powerful voice for our people and our community” in its Sunday statement.
    

            At a vigil hosted by Black Lives Matter UK on Monday evening outside Kings’ College Hospital in south London, supporters and fellow activists huddled under a bandstand and joined in lively chants of support and prayer, accompanied by drumming and movement.
    

            “Every time she grabbed the mic, she spoke the truth,” one supporter told the vigil. “We need to make enough noise so she can wake up,” the supporter added, met with cheers from the crowd.
    

            Leo Muhammad, told CNN that Johnson is a “warrior, a young sister who has been thrust to the forefront of the struggle for justice in the UK.”
    

            Muhammad, a friend of Johnson, said that although the facts of the shooting were still being established, “whether it was targeted or [whether] she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, the fact is, nobody is spraying bullets into white communities, but it’s a regular occurrence within the black community. We should be very concerned about that kind of activity.”
    

            Campaigner Caul Grant told CNN that he was “absolutely devastated” to hear about what happened to Johnson, saying that although he has only known Johnson for about a year, she has had a “huge impact” on his life as a young person in the community. 
    

            “No justice, no peace,” the crowd chanted.
    

            Earlier Monday, Black Lives Matter UK hailed Johnson as a “young mother and fearless political campaigner who was at the forefront of many BLM protests last summer,” in a message on Twitter.
    

            Several British lawmakers 
 paid tribute to the dedicated activist in the wake of the shooting.
    

            “Whoever carried out this dreadful shooting of Sasha Johnson needs to be caught quickly. Give any info you have to @MPSSouthwark. Reported death threats will need to be investigated,” wrote Harriet Harman, a Labour Member of Parliament for Camberwell and Peckham, who also wished Johnson a “full recovery.”
    

            Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, tweeted: “Nobody should have to potentially pay with their life because they stood up for racial justice.” 
    

            David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, described the news as “gut-wrenching” and said he was “Praying for Sasha Johnson, her family and friends that she makes a quick and full recovery.”
    

            Claudia Webbe, an MP for Leicester East, shared her “love and solidarity” with Johnson’s family and friends following the incident. 
    

            Webbe said news of the shooting was “shocking” and that “all women should be safe on our streets” in a tweet. 
    

            “When I think of the brutal shooting of Sasha Johnson it reminds me that the culture of gun violence is all-consuming affecting whole communities & neighbourhoods. The bullet does not discriminate in its effect. But too many women become collateral damage in this ‘culture of fear,’” Webbe said in a separate tweet.

2019-08-05T10:20:35Z,London teenager with learning disability disappears from remote Malaysian resort,"A 15-year-old girl with a learning disability has gone missing while on holiday in 
, in what police are treating as a possible abduction.
    

            Nora Quoirin, from London, was staying at a resort in a nature reserve 39 miles south of the capital, Kuala Lumpur.
    

            Her father discovered she was missing from her room at 8 a.m. local time on Sunday, and noticed that her window was open, according to the Lucie Blackman Trust (LBT) charity, which is assisting the family.
    

      
      

      

    

            Malaysian police have told the family the incident is being treated as both an abduction and a missing person case, the group told CNN.
    

            Quoirin, who has an Irish mother and a French father, was traveling on an Irish passport during the trip. The Dusun resort, where the family were staying, is in a remote area 800 feet above sea level, in the Titiwangsa mountain range.
    

            “This is a very vulnerable young girl missing in a remote location. She has been missing for over 24 hours now and it is imperative that every resource available is deployed to search for her,” LBT’s chief executive, Matthew Searle, said in a statement.
    

            “It is possible she has been seen or taken in by somebody and is unable to communicate, so we urge everyone who can to share our appeal poster and social media appeals,” he added. “Sadly it is also possible that Nora has been the victim of serious crime – we urge anyone with any information to come forward.”
    

            In a statement posted online, the management of the Dusun resort said that hotel staff searched the 12 acre (48,562 square meter) property “all Sunday morning,” before then joining the wider police search of the surrounding area. 
    

            Aisling Agnew, the girl’s aunt, was quoted by LBT as saying: “Nora’s parents and relatives in Ireland and France are distraught by her disappearance. Nora is a child with special needs and has learning and developmental disabilities which make her especially vulnerable and we fear for her safety.”
    

            “Nora would not know how to get help and would never leave her family voluntarily. We now consider this a criminal matter. We are appealing to everyone to assist the local police in any way they can and to pass on any information that would help locate our beloved Nora without delay.”
    

            The family have set up an email address for information – findnoraq@gmail.com – and the LBT has encouraged anyone with information about her disappearance to call +44 8000 988 485.

2016-03-09T19:24:20Z,Why British monarch stays above politics,"Buckingham Palace dismisses report of Queen backing British exit from EU
Constitutional role of British monarchs is to steer clear of politics
Queen Elizabeth II has political views but never makes them known in public

            The storm over Queen Elizabeth II’s reported views on the European Union and whether Britain should vote in a referendum to leave the EU cuts to the very heart of royal neutrality.
    

            

    

            The Sun newspaper published a front-page article Wednesday with the headline “Queen backs Brexit,” a term used to describe a potential “British exit” from the EU.
    

            In a dismissive statement about the report, Buckingham Palace said: “The Queen remains politically neutral as she has for 63 years. … The referendum is a matter for the British people to decide.”
    

            Ever since her ancestor King Charles I lost his head in 1649 following the English Civil War with Parliament, British monarchs’ constitutional role has gradually distilled to this: representing the whole country – and steering clear of politics.
    

            The 
underlined this reality when it became clear that Parliament would not even allow Edward VIII to marry Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee he loved, and remain king. 
    

      
      

      

    

            So the reason for Buckingham Palace’s frustration is simple: The royal family’s position requires the support of parliamentarians – on either side of the political divide. To support one party – or cause – will only lead to trouble further down the line.
    

            

    

            Of course, this is not to say that the Queen has no political views. Several of her prime ministers have recalled the 
she has given in the meetings she holds with them every week – but those words have always remained private.
    

            And while the royal family realizes it can only survive by appearing to be above the political fray – it is far from being politically naive. In 1917, near the end of World War I, the family changed its name from 
 to the more English-sounding Windsor amid widespread anti-German feeling.
    

            On rare occasions her thoughts have made it into the public domain. BBC correspondent Frank Gardner revealed in 2012 that the Queen told him she was surprised that radical Islamic cleric Abu Hamza was still free. 
 for disclosing the monarch’s remarks. 
    

            And during the Scottish referendum campaign, Elizabeth told a well-wisher outside a church that she hoped people would “
.” It was a rare moment of candor for someone well aware that anything she says in public has the potential to be picked up by reporters. 
    

            The situation is slightly different with other members of the royal family. Her heir, Prince Charles, is an outspoken supporter of environmental causes and 
expressing his views. Her husband, Prince Philip, is also famed for his forthright observations and jokes.
    

            

    

            Royal aides say Prince Charles will cease to express his opinions when he becomes king. Gradually he is being prepared for his future role: With a mother who has prided herself on never putting a foot wrong in public, Charles will realize the truth of the adage that silence is golden.

Finn will race until end of 2018 season

            Ferrari has extended the contract of Kimi Raikkonen until the end of next season, ending speculation the Finnish driver could be replaced. 
    

            Team president Sergio Marchionne labeled Raikkonnen
 before July’s Austrian Grand Prix, questioning the 37-year-old’s commitment and desire going forward in Formula One. 
    

            But recent good form – including podium finishes in the Finn’s last two races – have paved the way for another year at the Maranello outfit. 
    

            It will be Raikkonen’s fifth consecutive campaign with Ferrari, making him the Italian team’s second longest serving driver of all time.
    

            

    

            As it stands, only Michael Schumacher (179) and Felipe Massa (139) have made more grand prix starts than his total of 122. 
    

            Raikkonen previously raced for the Scuderia between 2007 and 2009, winning the driver’s world championship in his first year. 
    

            

    

            However, he hasn’t won a race in the Ferrari red since the 2009 Belgian Grand Prix. 
    

            While teammate Sebastian Vettel leads this year’s drivers’ championship, Raikonnen trails in fifth, 86 points behind, though on two occasions the Finn surrendered two possible victory chances  – in Monaco and Hungary – to boost the German’s title chances.

Novak Djokovic claims Doha title
Stan Wawrinka three-peat in India

            An ailing Roger Federer lost his Brisbane title to Milos Raonic Sunday as he slipped to a straights sets defeat to the big-serving Canadian.
    

            Federer was hoping to match world number one Novak Djokovic,  who began his 2016 campaign with a “perfect” performance to claim the Doha title 24 hours earlier, but came up well short.
    

            The 34-year-old Swiss maestro had started the week with a flu bug, improving each round until he came up against fourth seed Raonic in the final on the Pat Rafter Arena, losing 6-4 6-4.
    

            “I’ve still got a cough and the throat is a bit weird,” he told reporters after his defeat.
    

            “I’ve definitely got to make sure I get over it as quickly as possible.”

            Federer struggled with his first service throughout, facing and saving two break points in the fifth game before Raonic made the breakthrough on his second opportunity in the ninth.
    

            He served it out to take the opener in 41 minutes and the same pattern continued in the second set.
    

            Federer managed just one break point as Raonic served four double faults in the fourth game after having a medical time out for a right leg injury.
    

            The 17-time grand slam champion could not take advantage of the fleeting chance and was broken himself in the seventh game.
    

            Raonic claimed the title when Federer hit a backhand long, an immediate boost to his fortunes after a disappointing 2015 campaign, which saw him suffer with foot and back injuries. 
    

            It was his eight career crown and revenge for a three-set defeat to Federer in last year’s final in Brisbane.
    

            In an added twist, Raonic’s former coach Ivan Ljubicic has taken over the same duties with Federer, the Croat watching his defeat from a courtside box. 
    

            Raonic has paired up with former world number one Carlos Moya, who will be part of his team for the opening grand slam of the season in Melbourne.
    

            Reigning Australian Open champion Djokovic could hardly have had a better to his campaign to retain his title as he dispatched Spain’s Rafael Nadal 6-1 6-2 in the Qatar Open final Saturday.
    

            Nadal detained his arch-rival on court for just 73 minutes and has slipped behind in their head to head battle for the first time, Djokovic with 24 wins from 47 matches.
    

            It was the Serbian’s 60th career title and after not dropping a set all week acknowledged that he could not be in finer fettle.
    

            “I played pretty much perfect tennis today from the very beginning I managed to get every shot the way I wanted,” said Djokovic told gathered reporters.

            “I’m playing the tennis of my life, and I will try to nurture and cherish those moments on the court.,” he added.
    

            A dejected Nadal could only force one break point and was on the receiving end of 30 winners.
    

            “I played against a player who did everything perfect. I know nobody playing tennis like this ever. Since I know this sport I never saw somebody playing at this level,” was his verdict.
    

            “The only thing that you can do is wait that the opponent is not playing like this all the time. That is difficult to play like this all the time. It’s obvious. I am going to wait for my moment.”
    

            Meanwhile, in India, Federer’s compatriot and world number four Stanislas Wawrinka won the Chennai Open for the third straight year with a 6-3 7-5 victory over 19-year-old Croatian Borna Coric in Sunday’s final.
    

            Wawrinka, the only man to beat Djokovic in a grand slam last year, upsetting him in the final of the French Open, did not drop a set all week, but was extended by the promising Coric, who was playing his first ATP Tour final.

            So its no surprise that the legendary coach of the San Antonio Spurs, a winner of five NBA titles, had a strong response when asked why it’s important for the league to celebrate Black History Month.
    

            “I think it’s pretty obvious. Our league is made up of a lot of black guys,” Popovich told reporters Monday before the Spurs took on the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City. “To honor that and understand it is pretty simplistic. How would you ignore that? More importantly, we live in a racist country that hasn’t figured it out yet. 
    

            “It’s always important to bring attention to it, even if it angers some people. The point is, you have to keep it in front of everybody’s nose and understand that it still hasn’t been taken care of and we still have a lot of work to do.” 
    

            It’s not the first time Popovich has been outspoken about race or politics, especially about 
:
    

            “This man in the Oval Office is a soulless coward who thinks that he can only become large by belittling others.

It’s dangerous to our institutions and what we all stand for and what we expect the country to be.” – before the Spurs 
 in the Western Conference Finals.
    

            “It’s still early and I’m still sick to my stomach. Not basically because the Republicans won or anything, but the disgusting tenor and tone and all the comments that have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, and I live in that country where half the country ignored all that to elect someone.

2019-10-19T17:41:00Z,Super Saturday turns into Setback Saturday for Boris Johnson as Brexit plan unravels,"Barely 48 hours have passed since 
 when he reached an agreement with the European Union on 
 
    

            For a short period, the Prime Minister was walking on water in the eyes of his supporters. The surprise deal seemed to cause a groundswell of support and goodwill. So much so, that some of us in the House of Commons watching everything play out on what was supposed to be a 
 for British politics 
 to get his withdrawal deal approved by Parliament. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Then a bad thing happened. Oliver Letwin, a former Conservative Minister, tabled an amendment to Johnson’s motion that knocked the Prime Minister clean off his feet. 
    

            The Letwin amendment forced Johnson to send a letter to Brussels requesting an extension to the Brexit deadline. That’s because it withheld formal approval for Johnson’s deal until all the necessary legislation has passed. That could take days, if not weeks and certainly was not possible by 11 p.m. local time (6 p.m. ET) Saturday. 
    

            Johnson’s tone has been different of late. Gone is the flamboyant language, such as rather being “dead in a ditch” than request an extension or calling the Benn Act a “surrender bill”. Instead, he’s been talking about his love of Europe and his desire to reach across both the political divide and the nation in order to get a deal that works for the whole country. 
    

            In Brussels earlier this week, journalists were stunned at how well-received Johnson was by his EU counterparts. They congratulated him on striking this deal and applauded the manner in which he negotiated, which if you think back just a few months is nothing short of extraordinary. And he’d even got the entire Cabinet on message in regard to the Benn Act, saying that the government would “comply with the law.”
    

            But from the moment the Letwin amendment passed, we got a flash of the old Johnson. 
    

            He expressed his disappointment at the result and said that those MPs who’d backed Letwin had scuppered the “opportunity to have a meaningful vote” on his deal because “the meaningful vote has been voided of meaning.”
    

            He then slipped further back to his old habits of sowing confusion. 
    

            “And to anticipate the questions that are coming from the benches opposite, I will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so,” he said. 
    

            While Johnson didn’t go as far as saying he wouldn’t send the letter, he left enough room for people to think he was going to do something to sabotage a delay. 
    

      
      

      

    

            And in a briefing with government officials after the Prime Minister’s statement, Downing Street declined to clarify anything.
    

            They said that “governments comply with the law,” but not that this government led by Johnson would. 
    

            In the end, three letters were sent from Downing Street before the Benn Act’s deadline, including an unsigned letter from the Prime Minister to EU Council President Donald Tusk requesting the Brexit delay and another stressing the government’s desire for the request to not be granted, a senior British government source told CNN.
    

            It appeared that Johnson was again engaging in a bit of deliberate ambiguity, a feature of his leadership since taking office in July. 
    

            It’s a mind boggling end to a long week in British politics. It was a week which was supposed to provide some answers, and those answers were supposed to come on Super Saturday. But they didn’t. Instead, Brexit remains in a state of flux with no one sure what comes next; politicians as divided on an outcome as the public. 
    

            It’s both unhealthy and unbecoming for a nation as wealthy and important as the UK to be so obsessed with an issue that becomes unresolvable. And voters will be only too happy to let politicians know when they finally get the chance to vote."

            The vast majority of the field was at least able to tee-off before the weather turned but the top 10 players after Thursday and Friday’s opening rounds were unable to begin.
    
This is what we're waiting to pass at Baltusrol.
 

            “Play for the day has been canceled. The third round of the 98th PGA Championship will resume at (7am) on Sunday,” read a tweet from the PGA Championship event.
    

            Meanwhile, a note to competitors shared on the official PGA website shortly after stated that the final round will begin at 8.40am Sunday in the same pairings as round three.
    

            That would appear to leave open the possibility of the leading players completing two rounds Sunday should there be no further weather delays. Otherwise, play will likely be extended through to Monday.
    
Play for the day has been canceled. The THIRD ROUND of the 98th PGA Championship will resume at 7:00a.m. on Sunday, July 31, 2016.
The FINAL ROUND will begin at 8:40a.m. staying in the same pairings as Round 3, starting from Tee #1 (approx. 8:40am–3:25pm starting times)

            The last time the PGA Championship was held at Baltusrol was in 2005 when adverse weather also meant a Monday finish was required.
    

            Robert Streb and Jimmy Walker remain joint leaders at nine-under-par despite not striking a ball Saturday.
    

            Jason Day and Emiliano Grillo are tied for third two shots back on seven-under-par with recent British Open champion, Henrik Stenson, on six-under-par.
    

            

    

            Kevin Kisner made the most of an early start Saturday to record an impressive 65 to move into a tie for sixth position at five-under-par alongside Martin Kaymer, Patrick Reed and Brooks Kopka.   
    

            Ireland’s Padraig Harrington also shot up the leaderboard with a 65 of his own to be tie for tenth at four-under-par.
    

            Phil Mickelson could only make a two-under-par 68 to move up to joint 48th position Saturday. 
    

            But the 2005 PGA Championship winner told reporters that a record major score could be achieved over the coming days.
    
""I think someone's going to shoot 61 or 62."" 
Phil Mickelson thinks history will be made this weekend at Baltusrol. 

            Streb notched up a record equaling 63 Friday and Mickelson believes that could be bettered thanks to the generous way the course is playing. 
    

            No player has ever shot lower than a 63 in a major tournament.
    

            

    

            “The golf course is susceptible to very low scoring,” Mickelson told reporters. “There is a low 60s round. I think somebody is going to break that 63 record in these next two days.” 
    

            “The greens are pristine. You can make a lot of putts. They are soft, so you can get the ball very close. I think that there’s that 61 or 62.”"

2021-11-03T16:28:37Z,An Italian couple thought they were being burgled. Then they found a bear on their balcony,"A couple in central 
 who thought they were being burgled were instead shocked to find an endangered brown 
 on their balcony.
    

            Annalisa Castagna and her husband, Claudio Paravano, were alarmed by a noise outside their property and went to investigate, only to find themselves face to face with a Marsican brown bear, Castagna 
 published Sunday.
    

            They had “a close encounter with the bear. We were face to face, less than a meter away,” she wrote. “I was able to count all the teeth he had in his mouth plus the red tongue.”
    

            Castagna said she “screamed in the bear’s face” and the animal then tried to reach her with its paw.
    

            The encounter happened at the couple’s home in the village of Pescosolido, home to fewer than 1,500 people, on the edges of the Abruzzo National Park in central Italy.
    

            The park is home to around 60 Marsican bears, which are smaller than those found in the Alps, “but they can still reach 200 kilos,” said town mayor Donato Bellisario.
    

            “Before going into hibernation, the bears are in a period of hyperphagia (extreme hunger), they need to store energy for the winter,” Bellisario told CNN on Wednesday. “We often see them in the village searching for fruit, bees’ hives, but they never attacked men.”
    

      
      

      

    

            Bellisario said he and a few guards from the national park had inspected the couple’s balcony to determine what had attracted the bear, but they couldn’t tell.
    

            While Castagna escaped unscathed from the encounter, Paravano “was forced to jump over the fence,” according to the Facebook post. He fell three meters (10 feet) and suffered a fractured pelvis, said Bellisario, and faces a couple of months of recovery. 
    

            Only a few days before that incident, a Marsican bear was spotted taking an evening bath in the fountain of a nearby village, San Donato Val Di Comino.  
    

            “The bear has arrived in the village and takes a bath in the fountain of the public garden,” reads the caption of a photo 
.
    

            The photo was taken by Vania Tramontozzi, whose husband runs a bar in the central square of the village.
    

            “The bear’s arrival was not initially noticed, it was really quiet,” she told CNN. “I assure you that seeing him so calm and relaxed inside the fountain, at about 7.45 pm, when people are still around, was a rare and exciting thing.”"

Investigators say the counterterror operation followed an attack Friday, state media say
Security has been stepped up in Russia ahead of the Winter Olympics next month
Dagestan is about a 12-hour drive from Sochi, host city for the Games

            Security forces killed seven militants in a counterterrorism operation in Russia’s southern republic of Dagestan, security officials said Saturday, according to the country’s state news agency RIA Novosti. 
    

            The six men and one woman were killed after a siege in Makhachkala, capital city of Dagestan, Russia’s Anti-Terrorism Committee said in a prepared statement, RIA Novosti reported.
    

            The operation came after 16 people, including several police officers, were injured Friday in explosions from a grenade launcher and a car bomb targeting a restaurant in Makhachkala, the news agency reported, citing investigators.
    

            The investigators said that the seven killed Saturday included a local militant leader and the widow of a dead militant preparing for a suicide attack, RIA Novosti added.
    

            Some of them tried unsuccessfully to break out while a house was under siege overnight, state-run Itar-Tass reported, quoting security and law enforcement officials.
    

            The latest incident follows years of unrest linked to an Islamist insurgency in Dagestan and the North Caucasus region.
    

            It also came as Russian security forces have tried to address security concerns before next month’s Winter Olympics in Sochi, which is perhaps a 12-hour drive from Dagestan on the other side of the Caucasus range.
    

            Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that his government is doing “everything possible” to make sure the Olympics will be secure. What it will not do, he insisted in an address broadcast by several television networks, is shudder in the face of the threats.
    

            Concerns about security in Russia were heightened after twin bombings on public transit that killed more than 30 people in the southern city of Volgograd at the end of last month.
    

            Just Wednesday, another four militants and three Russian security force members died in a shootout in Dagestan.

Dan Carter named World Rugby Player of the Year

            He played a key part in New Zealand’s Rugby World Cup final triumph – and then stole the show by a remarkable act of generousness to a teenage pitch invader.
    

            All Blacks center 
 was awarded a second World Cup winner’s medal having given away his previous gong  to 14-year-old Charlie Lines moments after Saturday’s final ended.
    

            Williams, whose offload paved the way for Ma’a Nonu’s second-half try in 
, had been parading around the pitch following the successful defense of New Zealand’s world title when Lines rushed onto the field.

            The teenager was tackled to the ground by a steward before being helped to his feet by Williams and returned to friends and family in the stands after which the All Black placed his precious medal around the young fan’s neck.
    

            

    

            The gesture led to global headlines and the young fan even offered to give the medal back.
    

            But Williams’ response on Twitter was: “For a kid 2 have that will and take that risk, you deserve a medal.”

          Post has been removed or is no longer public.
        

            Williams, though, was not to return home to New Zealand empty handed after being handed a second medal at the World Rugby Awards in London Sunday.
    

            The All Black received a standing ovation as he took to the stage, while the master of ceremonies Alex Payne said: “World Rugby would like every winner to go home with a medal and they have found a final one.”
    

            Typically the 30-year-old Williams downplayed the magnitude of his gesture: “I’m really surprised, most of the boys would have done the same.”
    

      
      

      

    

            At the time of the event, the player explained the reasoning behind his instinctive reaction: “A young fella snuck onto the field somehow but when he was coming up to give me a hug, he got smoked by a security guard, full-on tackled him.
    

            “The other fella was a big man so he was lucky he didn’t break his ribs or something. I think the moment got the better of him but he was just so excited to get onto the field with the All Blacks. I just thought I’d make it a night to remember for him.
    

            “Rather than have the medal hanging up at home, it’s going to hanging around that young fella’s neck. He can tell that story for a long time to come.”
    

            Williams will be definitely keeping hold of his new medal, with the former rugby league player tweeting his thanks to tournament officials.

2014-04-10T12:02:05Z,The Masters: Why the man who designed Augusta died in poverty,"Follow us at 
 and 


Alister MacKenzie, a physician turned golf architect, designed famed Augusta National course
The Scot was enlisted to help by Bobby Jones, a multiple golf champion of the 1920s
MacKenzie never received full payment for his work and died before first Masters was held
Many of his design principles still permeate the course despite many changes over the years

            “Can you possibly let me have, at any rate, five hundred dollars to keep us out of the poor house?” 
    

            These are not the words you expect to hear from a man who designed one of the world’s most famous golf courses.
    

            Dr. Alister MacKenzie, the brains behind Augusta National’s revered contours and curves – elegantly showcased each year by the Masters – died pleading poverty in 1934 and begging for his fee.
    

            He never even saw his finished work before his death, which came less than three months before the first Masters tournament was held.
    

            “I have been reduced to playing golf with four clubs,” he wrote in a letter to Augusta National, recorded in 
a book by David Owen commissioned by the club.
    

            “I am at the end of my tether, no-one has paid me a cent since last June, we have mortgaged everything we have and have not yet been able to pay the nursing expenses of my wife’s operation.”
    

            MacKenzie, a physician turned golf architect, had embarked on a pilgrimage that had taken him from a modest town in northern England to the pacific coast in California.
    

            His journey incorporated a stint in the Boer War, which influenced his underpinning principles of course design, and saw his work evolve during the boom and bust years of the 1920s.
    

            By the time he was enlisted to build a championship course for all of America by its biggest sports star of the age, MacKenzie was the preeminent golf architect of his time.
    

            Bobby Jones had won the grand slam as an amateur in 1930 – capturing all four major tournaments in the calendar year – before he stunned the public by announcing his retirement aged just 28.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            He determined to construct an exclusive golf course in the sun-blushed south of the United States that would offer him twin benefits: sanctuary from his fame and a healthy stream of income.
    

            But though Jones declared himself delighted with the finished product, and its architect trumpeted Augusta as his finest creation, MacKenzie was almost destitute by the time he died.
    

            He halved his fee to $5,000 in a bid to be paid quickly, but clawed back just $2,000, with several other golf courses also slow to settle their debts.
    

            It was symptomatic of the financial difficulties Augusta encountered in its fledgling years, exacerbated by the Great Depression, a fact that seems inconceivable given the club’s towering strength in the present day.
    

            “Augusta struggled a lot in the early years and found it very hard to attract members they wanted,” Adam Lawrence, editor of Golf Course Architecture magazine, told CNN.
    

            “They were really struggling for money. MacKenzie didn’t get full payment paid for his work at Augusta – until he died he was writing letters asking perhaps they could send part of the fee.
    

            “MacKenzie divorced his first wife and was living what would appear to be an expensive lifestyle in California. He was basically bankrupt when he died.
    

            “There were a lot of golf architects from that time who were the same. Most seemed to be terrible businessmen and there were a few bad habits like too much booze flying around.”
    

            

    

            MacKenzie’s portrait still watches over the course where his maverick design ideas were first put into practice over 100 years ago.
    

            Despite the odd tweak, Alwoodley Golf Club – just outside the city of Leeds in the north of England – still boasts many of the original characteristics conceived by the Scot.
    

            As Nick Leefe, secretary of the Alister MacKenzie Society, told CNN, the physician’s long-held affection for the game even permeated some of his diagnoses. 
    

            “How frequently have I, with great difficulty, persuaded patients who were never off my doorstep to take up golf, and how rarely, if ever, have I seen them in my consulting rooms again!” MacKenzie is reported to have proclaimed.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            This love of golf sparked an interest in course architecture after a period serving during the Second Boer War, between the British and the South African Republic, at the turn of the 20th century. 
    

            “The attitude of the Boers towards camouflage got him interested in disguise and trickery,” Leefe explains. “People suggest this is the reason he came back after the war and took an interest in golf design.”
    

            When a group of businessman joined together in 1907 to build Alwoodley, MacKenzie presented his designs and had them rubber-stamped by Harry Colt – another famed architect of the age who worked as a consultant on the project.
    

            MacKenzie’s fundamental belief was that a good golf course should provide a stern test for a good player but not prove impossible for average players.
    

            Also included in his manifesto was an insistence that a player should be required to utilize a variety of shots to prosper and that every hole should have a different character where possible.
    

            Among the more eccentric attributes listed was the suggestion that though the course should be sufficiently undulating, there should be no hill climbing, and that a complete absence of irritation caused by looking for lost balls was preferable.
    

            “Alwoodley is very proud indeed because we have the original MacKenzie design and we are very proud to introduce people to it,” Leefe says.
    

            “MacKenzie was a pioneer and went on to become one of the best known architects of his time. He’s become much more famous after his death and the golfing public have realized what great courses he’s made.
    

            “There are a lot of the original MacKenzie characteristics on show at Alwoodley. We try our best when we restore the course or renovate course to keep to the original design of which we have a copy.”
    

            

    

            MacKenzie had carved a formidable reputation for himself by the time he left for the United States in 1926.
    

            But it was his work on the Californian coast that would pique the interest of Bobby Jones and lead to his most memorable tender – designing Augusta National.
    

            Many believe MacKenzie’s true masterpiece to be Cypress Point, which he designed to complement its proximity to the rugged Pacific Ocean coastline.
    

            By the time Jones had completed his first round on the Monterey Peninsula he vowed to employ MacKenzie to build his very own course.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            It seemed the logical choice, given how closely their vision for the ideal golf course was.
    

            “We believe that no good golf hole exists that does not afford a proper and convenient solution to the average golfer and the short player, as well as to the more powerful and accurate expert,” Jones was reported as saying.
    

            But by the time $100,000 had been spent transforming an Augusta fruit plantation into a golf course, the political and financial landscape had changed dramatically thanks to the stock market crash of 1929.
    

            The exuberant flourishes on show via a series of elaborate bunkers at Cypress Point and another of MacKenzie’s fabled courses – Royal Melbourne in Australia – gave way to a more modest design in which contour was king.
    

            “Originally, Augusta was light on bunkers – it has many more today than it used to have,” says Lawrence. “Augusta was one of the very last things MacKenzie did before he died and it seems he was moving away from those flashy bunkers. 
    

            “He was working in a style that was appropriate of the era of depression when Augusta was built. It wasn’t about sand or water – what defined it were the contours of the land.
    

            “You can take a flag stick and put in a flat area and it’s a very easy golf hole; you can put it behind a little hump and it’s an almost impossible golf hole.”
    

            

    

            In those early years of struggle, the notion of Augusta preparing to host the 78th installment of the Masters in 2014 would have seemed quite fanciful.
    

            As Owen reports in “The Making of the Masters,” let alone having the funds to pay MacKenzie for his design, the club could barely cover its staff’s $200 weekly wage bill in the early 1930s.
    

            The idea to create a yearly tournament, initially called the Augusta National Invitational Tournament, helped stave off the threat of financial ruin and generated plenty of interest when Jones came out of retirement to play in the first one. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            But what really catapulted the club into the public’s consciousness was Gene Sarazen’s “shot heard around the world” during the 1935 event.
    

            The American was trailing the leaders by three shots when his double eagle on the par-five 15th hole helped him cut the deficit with one stroke, paving the way for his eventual win in a playoff.
    

            That landmark moment is testament to the principals upon which MacKenzie’s design was built. 
    

            Various tweaks over the years have stripped many of his original features from the course, most of them dictated by the modern player’s ability to hit the ball over a hundred yards further than their predecessors.
    

            But as Owen wrote: “MacKenzie’s and Jones’ ideas about golf course design continue to define the Masters in ways that modern golf fans may not fully appreciate.”
    

            The pair’s commitment to break from the culture of golf design at the time – which penalized poor shots harshly – has engendered some of the greatest finishes in major golf.
    

            As Owen makes clear, the plentiful birdie and eagle opportunities down the closing stretch discourage any conservatism, as anyone in with a sniff of winning charges for the finish line.
    

            But it’s not just at Augusta that MacKenzie’s legacy is felt – an estimated 100 clubs as far afield as Buenos Aires and Blackpool have been touch by his hand.
    

            “MacKenzie is undoubtedly one of the most important figures in terms of the evolution of golf course design,” Lawrence says.
    

            “Augusta, Cypress Point and Royal Melbourne are three courses that would typically be in the top 10 in the world in most rankings, and the fact all three courses have MacKenzie’s footprint is pretty impressive.”
    

            MacKenzie may be long gone, but he lives on in the soul of golf courses the world over."
2013-04-01T21:00:24Z,Campaigners push for Page 3 cover up at Murdoch’s Sun,"Campaigners hope UK's biggest newspaper will stop publishing topless model photos
Rupert Murdoch, owner of The Sun, tweeted the Page 3 girl might be outdated
Even one former model now says it is time for Page 3 to end
The Sun uses its models in journalism campaigns and marketing

            The UK’s highest selling newspaper may be embarking on a giant cover up – much to the delight of its critics – and putting an end to a tradition opponents see as sexist and outdated.
    

            The Sun’s topless model on Page 3 has been a tradition since the 1970s. A  photo of a bare-breasted young woman along with a corny caption was the newspaper’s way of giving its largely male readers a break from the often depressing news of the day.
    

            Page 3 quickly became part of The Sun’s brand, making the transition from black and white photos to color, then onto the paper’s website. Page 3 models often support The Sun’s campaigning journalism and are taken on tours to meet serving military.
    

            Nudity in newspapers is not the exclusive domain of The Sun. The press and advertising campaigns will often use flesh to draw in the eyeballs in parts of Europe.
    

            But now The Sun’s owner Rupert Murdoch – 
 – has raised the specter of a world without Page 3. Murdoch said: “
 page three so last century! You maybe right, don’t know but considering. Perhaps halfway house with glamorous fashionistas.”
    

            Murdoch later tempered this, saying it was the editor’s call. But it was music to the ears of campaigners at “
.”  The campaign was started by Lucy Holmes when she realized the day after Jessica Ennis won Olympic gold in the heptathlon for Great Britain last summer “the largest female image in The Sun was of a young woman showing her breasts.”
    

            On April 1, it had 88,000 signatures supporting an end to Page 3. 
 and has many more readers as each copy sold is read by friends or family.
    

            A spokesperson for News International said: “In a YouGov survey commissioned last October almost two thirds of 
 and notably it has more than seven million readers daily of which 45 per cent are female. It remains the UK’s biggest selling newspaper which means its formula – brilliant journalism, entertainment, outstanding sports writing – and Page 3, is working.”
    

            The YouGov survey also found readers of most of the other national papers were more likely to favor an end to the Sun’s Page 3.
    

            Meanwhile, the UK media landscape is changing after the Leveson Inquiry into phone hacking. 
, its sister paper The News of the World was closed by Murdoch and codes of conduct are being imposed on the media. The emphasis is on ethics, and that might not sit well on Page 3.
    

            One anti-Page 3 campaigner, Laura Ashton, told CNN: “It’s exploitative, it’s from the 1970s, and the girls back then were very young they were putting in the newspaper. They’re not much older now. But it really feels very outdated, that kind of sexism.”
    

            Others have tried before. Clare Short was a leading Labour Party MP when in 1986 she tried unsuccessfully to push through legislation that would have outlawed topless models in newspapers.  In 2007, Short tried again, only for The Sun to launch a “
” campaign with models being driven by bus to pose outside to the former MP’s home.
    

            In the UK, topless and nude model magazines are largely restricted to the top shelves of stores  where children can’t reach them. Only a couple of newspapers containing nudity are put on bottom shelf.
    

            Elsewhere in Europe, different standards apply in different markets with topless models used on advertising hoardings for everything from soap to sweaters.
    

            Some of the UK’s Page 3 models have used their exposure as  launchpad for other careers. Sam Fox, perhaps the best-known of them, had a string of pop hits.
    

            And Linda Lusardi, another pin-up of the 1980s, became an actress in long-running UK shows like “The Bill” and “Emmerdale.” 
    

            But even Lusardi, voted by Sun readers in 2005 as the best Page 3 girl ever, said: “It’s time for it to go. I really think things have moved on so far with the internet and with everything else that I don’t feel that we really need that in our national newspapers anymore.”"

Workers and a counselor killed, several hurt in blaze in southwestern Germany
An explosion in a storage room may have started the fire, police say

            Fire raged through a workshop for the disabled in southwestern Germany on Monday, killing 14 people, police said.
    

            The victims were identified as workers and a counselor at the Caritas workshop in the town of Titisee-Neustadt, said Karl-Heinz Schmid, a Freiburg police spokesman.
    

            Several other people were hurt, he said.
    

            Another member of the Freiburg police said an explosion in a storage room may have caused the fire that prompted a major response from firefighting crews.
    

            Dr. Peter Neher, president of the German Caritas Association, extended sympathies to the victims’ families.
    

            “We know that the responsible colleagues on site will do everything to find out the causes of this horrible event,” he said in a statement.
    

            Caritas International is a “global confederation of 165 Catholic organizations working in humanitarian emergencies and international development,” according to its website.

2013-05-20T08:16:16Z,Should tennis be worried about the ‘kissing disease’?,"Some of tennis' biggest names, including Roger Federer, have been felled by mono
Extensive training, matches and traveling may make players more vulnerable
Diagnosing the illness can be difficult, says an expert who has worked with athletes with mono
The men's tennis tour says cases of mono haven't been unusually high 

            Christina McHale, energy sapped and unable to train properly, knew something was wrong last year. Exercises she once did easily were becoming harder and getting through matches was proving difficult, too. 
    

            It was a surprise, since the young American prospect was considered a player with good stamina and has already earned a reputation for wearing down her opponents, not vice versa.  
    

            After a first-round victory at the French Open, McHale felt particularly exhausted.
    

            “I won 6-4 in the third set, but I remember saying to my coach that I feel like I’ve just been hit by a bus,” the 21-year-old recalled. 
    

            At first she thought it was a sinus infection. Then a couple of months later, following the Olympic tennis event at Wimbledon, McHale picked up a stomach bug and had to go to hospital. Her ordeal dragged on. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “I kept going back to the doctors because I wasn’t getting better,” McHale said. “I was still feeling very low on energy and they were like, ‘No, you should already be over the stomach virus.’ So then they started doing more tests, and that’s when they found out what it was.” 
    

            The diagnosis was mononucleosis, a viral illness that can linger for weeks, months or even years. It has earned the nickname of the “kissing disease” because it can get passed from one person to another through saliva. Fortunately for McHale, her bout was coming to an end. 
    

            McHale, though, isn’t the only tennis player in recent years to be afflicted with mono or the name it’s also known by, glandular fever. 
    

            

    

            Top men’s players Roger Federer, Andy Roddick, Robin Soderling, Mario Ancic and John Isner have been struck down, while Heather Watson, like McHale a player with promise, revealed she had mono in April. 
    

            Jarmila Gajdosova, another promising player on the women’s tour, announced last week on Twitter that she had mono. 
    

            Soderling and Ancic weren’t as lucky as the likes of Federer, McHale and Watson, who hopes to return to action at the French Open, which starts this weekend. Indeed the severity of cases varies, as does an individual’s capacity to fight off and cope with infections. 
    

            

    

            Soderling, the French Open finalist in 2009 and 2010, hasn’t played since 2011 and it is looking increasingly likely that he won’t ever come back. 
    

            The Swede with the massive forehand – who handed Rafael Nadal his only defeat at Roland Garros – started to feel unwell in the spring of 2011 and later said it was a mistake to compete at Wimbledon that year.  
    

            Ancic, hailed as a potential winner at Wimbledon after reaching the semifinals in 2004, attempted to play through his flu-like symptoms during a Davis Cup series against Germany in 2007.
    

            He said he felt so dizzy in his singles opener he missed a ball completely, but he still contested the doubles a day later. 
    

            He was ready to play the deciding fifth rubber if needed, although with Germany already clinching the tie he was replaced by a young Marin Cilic. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “God saved me,” Ancic, known for his work ethic and willingness to play through injuries, said in an interview in 2007.    
    

            Ancic re-emerged on the tour but was never the same and a teary-eyed Croatian had to retire two years ago aged 26. 
    

            Andy Murray, the current world No. 2, feared he had mono four years ago, and it’s an illness he’s still wary of, telling the Daily Telegraph in March: “You can get run down and end up missing two or three months of the year because of an illness.
    

            “Your immune system gets run down and then you lose weight. It’s happened with a lot of guys with glandular fever the last few years so it’s something everyone has to look into.”  
    

            
 
    

            Former pro Justin Gimelstob isn’t surprised that tennis players are susceptible.
    

            The players have to, at times, switch continents on a weekly basis, and they travel 10-11 months in a year.
    

            Unlike golf, cricket or Formula One, others sports that require continual global travel, the players also push themselves to the limit physically. 
    

            The career of Gimelstob, who now commentates and serves as a player representative on the ATP World Tour’s board of directors, was blighted by a back injury. 
    

            “I think that’s the thing people don’t understand – the heightened intensity does damage to your body, immune system, energy levels, on the fitness of your muscles, ligaments, tendons,” Gimelstob said.
    

            “It’s just a very tough sport. I truly believe that Nadal, Murray, (Novak) Djokovic and Federer, these guys aren’t only the best tennis athletes in the world, they are some of the best athletes in the world.
    

            “There’s a whole culture of being tough and strong and pushing through pain and being a warrior. 
    

            “But I can tell you right now at 37 years old walking my dog, my body feels the brunt of probably doing a lot of things and pushing through barriers I probably shouldn’t have. That’s the product of an individual sport.” 
    

            

    

            At first Leslie Findley, a consultant neurologist in England who has treated marathon runners, footballers and tennis players with mono, said it was a “myth” that those involved in tennis are more vulnerable than other athletes. 
    

            But he subsequently acknowledged that when factoring in their travel, the severity of the illness can intensify. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “We know people with fatigue illnesses related to the effects of viruses travel badly,” he said.
    

            “If you take someone with a chronic fatigue syndrome and stick them on an airplane at (London’s) Heathrow to the United States they’ll do an eight-hour flight. That can have a devastating effect on them for days afterwards.”
    

            Preventing mono can be difficult, but Findley said it’s important that players heed warnings. If they suddenly develop a cold, fever, sore throat or stomach issues, it’s vital to rest instead of continuing to train and play matches. 
    

            
 
    

            As Gimelstob pointed out and Findley knows through his own experience in working with sportsmen and women, that isn’t always easy. 
    

            “When you and I have the flu, we go to bed and within a week or two we’d be back to normal,” Findley said.
    

            “Why these people get symptoms that go on for weeks, months and years is usually because – and I’m now generalizing – they don’t stop when they have the first symptoms and tend to push through, and they’re under stress.”   
    

            Diagnosing mono isn’t simple, either, said Findley.
    

            He said there is a lack of specialists and that doing a battery of tests at the outset may not be efficient. He will usually spend nearly two hours talking to patients in a first consultation before making a clinical diagnosis. 
    

            “Then there are a limited number of blood tests that need to be done to make sure there is nothing else contributing to it,” Findley said. 
    

            The women’s tennis tour said in an email that player health and well being was a “priority.” But the age of many of its pros is another reason why tennis players would appear to be at risk.   
    

            “Mononucleosis most commonly occurs in people between the ages of 15 and 24, which is our athlete population,” said Kathleen Stroia, senior vice president, sport sciences and medicine & transitions, with the WTA.  
    

            The men’s tour said in an email that mono “has not been of unusual concern for the players or the ATP Medical Services.” 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “Professional athletes are not immune to illnesses which affect the general public in general,” said Gary Windler, medical advisor to the ATP World Tour. 
    

            “While we are concerned about and take all injuries and illness seriously, and although some high profile players have suffered from glandular fever in recent years, the incidence of this particular illness amongst our players in general has not been unusually high.” 
    

            McHale didn’t think her tour needed to do more to help players.   
    

            “I think we’re probably more susceptible to getting it because our bodies are more run down from traveling so much,” she said.
    

            “Also sometimes I take a water bottle – they all look the same – to the court and all of a sudden I’m like, ‘This wasn’t my water bottle.’ Sometimes it gets transferred like that.
    

            “I know a lot of my friends have gotten it. They’re not athletes. For them it wasn’t a big issue. It’s amplified when you’re an athlete.”
    

            

    

            Her road back hasn’t been smooth. 
    

            McHale, like others before her, didn’t stop playing for a while. But after losing five straight matches, she finally decided to sit out the remainder of 2012 and not contest the European indoor swing. The losing streak rose to eight by the time this January’s Australian Open ended. 
    

            As high as No. 24 in the world last summer, her health issues largely contributed to her ranking sliding to 55th.  
    

            She has resumed training fully and played for nearly three hours against 2012 French Open finalist Sara Errani in Rome on Wednesday but knows she must be careful.
    

            “They did tell me there’s a chance I could get a relapse, so I have to take it easy if I’m feeling extremely exhausted,” she said. “But I think I’m past that point. I don’t feel any side effects of what I had. I feel like I’m fully over it now. I was lucky my case wasn’t extremely bad like some others.”"
2021-08-02T16:07:35Z,Jade Carey: Gold medal winner says Simone Biles told her to go and ‘kill floor’,"With the words of USA teammate 
 resounding in her ears – “Go out and kill floor” – gymnast Jade Carey did just that at the Tokyo 
 on Monday.
    

            Carey finished eighth in Sunday’s vault final – she made a mistake on the first of her two vaults – but the American was back to her best as she won the gold medal in the women’s floor exercise with a score of 14.366 at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
    

            Italian Vanessa Ferrari claimed silver – her first Olympic medal in her fourth Games – while bronze went to Angelina Melnikova of the 
and Japan’s Mai Murakami.
    

            “Coming back from a day like yesterday, I’m really proud of myself for being able to put that behind me and finish with probably the best floor routine I’ve ever done in my life,” Carey told reporters as she reflected on the difference in her vault and floor performances.
    

            “Yesterday was very tough for me,” added Carey. “I tripped, I guess, in my hurdle, or right before. I don’t even know. It’s kind of a blur now. It was really hard, but I’m glad I’m safe and healthy. Doing that second vault, it was a challenge, but I didn’t want to give up. For tonight, I just had to let that go and give it my all.”
    

            According to Carey, all her USA gymnastics teammates were supportive of her after the vault final, but that Biles “especially” helped the 21-year-old gymnast “let it go and move on.”
    

            “She said: ‘It happened, and you can’t do anything about it.’ She was like, ‘Let’s go out and kill floor,’ and that’s what I did.”
    

            Carey is coached by her father Brian, and the American gymnast said having him at the Ariake Gymnastics Centre meant “everything” to her.
    

            “This is all we’ve ever dreamed of,” said the US gymnast. “It’s really special to be able to get this medal with him out there by my side.
    

            “I talked to my dad last night, and we decided together that we were just going to let it go the best we could, and both put everything we could into tonight.”
    

            Earlier on Monday, Team USA confirmed 
would take part in Tuesday’s balance beam final.
    

            Biles – arguably the greatest gymnast of all time – participated in the Olympic qualifications on July 25 and then in the US’s vault rotation in the women’s team final on July 27 before withdrawing from competitive action, citing mental health concerns."
2019-06-16T12:56:45Z,Meghan and Harry release new photo of Archie for Father’s Day,"The 
 have released a new image of their son, 
, in honor of Father’s Day. 
    

            The photo, which appeared on the royal couple’s 
, features Archie clutching Prince Harry’s finger. “Wishing a very special first Father’s Day to The Duke of Sussex,” the post states. 
    

            The couple also posted a photo in May in honor of Mother’s Day in the many countries across the globe that celebrate it, including Meghan’s native America. 
    

            “Paying tribute to all mothers today – past, present, mothers-to-be, and those lost but forever remembered,” the post stated, “We honor and celebrate each and every one of you.”
    

            The photos are the only times that Archie has been seen since he was presented to the world in St. George’s Hall in Windsor Castle only days after his birth on May 6. 
    

            New details have just emerged about Archie’s christening, which is set to take place at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle in July, according to 
. 
    

            Richard Fitzwilliams, a royal expert, told CNN that the christening will almost certainly take place at the chapel as it is where Harry was christened in 1984, and where he and Meghan tied the knot in May 2018. 
    

            More recently, the chapel has played host to the weddings of Prince Andrew’s daughter Princess Eugenie to Jack Brooksbank in October 2018, and Lady Gabriella Windsor to financier Thomas Kingston in May 2019. 
    

            Fitzwilliams noted that the christening will be a “highly significant” event, as Archie is the first royal baby born to parents of different ethnicities. He noted that the christening will highlight a “changing royal family which reflects society as a whole in modern Britain as in the Commonwealth more closely.” 
    

            Yet despite Meghan’s push for modernity, which has included championing women’s rights, the christening is expected to be a traditional affair, Fitzwilliams added.
    

            Archie will reportedly be baptized with water from the River Jordan, which holds particular significance for the Jewish and Christian faiths, as it is believed to be where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. 
    

            The paper added that the royal baby will also be dressed in an exact replica of the historic royal christening gown, which was commissioned by Queen Victoria and first used in 1841 for the baptism of her eldest daughter, Princess Victoria. 
    

            The original, which was made from Spitalfields silk and Honiton lace, was worn by 62 royal babies, including Queen Elizabeth at her christening in 1926, Prince Harry and Prince William. 
    

            A replica of the gown was commissioned by the Queen in 2004, however, as the original was deemed too fragile for further use. The most recent royal babies to don the replica were Prince George in 2013 and Princess Charlotte in 2015. 
    

            The christening will also feature the Lily Font, a silver-gilt receptacle which was commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1840, the Sunday Times added. 
    

            The font, which is stored at the Tower of London when not in use, has been used for the christenings of all of the Queen’s children and grandchildren, excluding Princess Eugenie. 
    

            Fitzwilliams noted that royal christenings are often small and private affairs, which are attended by “senior royals, family, close friends and the godparents and their spouses.” 
    

            The Queen is nevertheless expected to be absent at the celebrations due to prior engagements, according to the newspaper. While the monarch attended the christenings of Prince George and Princess Charlotte in recent years, she was noticeably absent from Prince Louis’s baptism last year.
    

            The ceremony is expected to be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Right Reverend David Conner, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who is head of the Church of England. 
    

            Conner has recently conducted the marriage ceremonies of Meghan and Harry, Princess Eugenie and Lady Gabriella Windsor."
2018-11-23T13:18:50Z,"From Ferrari to Mercedes, the top 10 most iconic Formula One cars","Maurice Hamilton is a Formula One author and journalist and has been covering the sport for more than four decades. He has attended more than 450 grands prix and written 19 books.


            It’s been a thrilling Formula One season and as the 2018 campaign reaches its conclusion on Sunday at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, CNN Sport takes a look at some of the cars that have defined the sport over the years.
    

            As race statistics go, the Maserati 250F barely makes an impression; just eight Grand Prix wins and a single drivers’ title between 1954 and 1959. 
    

            Aside from the constructors’ championship not being created until 1958, the paucity of results makes no difference to the 250F’s reputation as one of the finest and most graceful F1 cars ever built. 
    

            Having raced before and after World War II, the Italian firm produced the 250F to meet a change to 2.5-litre engines in Formula 1 for 1954.
    

            

    

            

    

            From the moment it first appeared, the Maserati satisfied the ideal of what a Grand Prix car should look like; pure of line, the long, gently curved bodywork with its low snout finished off in a rich red, the Italian national racing color. 
    

            Not only was the 250F aesthetically satisfying, it was also a pleasure to drive. A finely balanced chassis allowed drivers to use the throttle as a means of powering the 250F through corners with the shapely tail hanging out. 
    

            The Argentine maestro, Juan Manuel Fangio, used the 250F to display his thrilling virtuosity as he won the 1957 world championship with ease. 
    

            Surviving examples change hands at auction for seven figure sums; an indication of arguably the most iconic F1 car of all time.
    

            Colin Chapman, the boss of Lotus and an engineering genius, revolutionized racing car construction by designing the monocoque chassis. 
    

            This fully stressed aluminum bathtub shape was three times stiffer and half the weight of the popular structure of welded tubes making up a so-called space frame chassis. 
    

            Introduced halfway through 1962, the Lotus 25 was instantly competitive and would have won the championship but for an engine failure at the final race. 
    

            Coupled with driving brilliance of Jim Clark, however, the Lotus 25 totally dominated the 1963 championship with seven wins. 
    

            The monocoque construction would become the standard for F1 design, spreading eventually to every racing formula.  
    

            Clark would also have won the 1964 world title but for an engine failure on the last lap of the final race – a development of the concept, the Lotus 33, easily took Clark to his second championship the following year. 
    

            A major change of formula for 1966 gave Chapman the opportunity to advance his thinking further with the Lotus 49 by attaching the engine directly to the monocoque (as opposed to supporting it in a separate frame). 
    

            The 49 went on to win the championship with Graham Hill in 1968 (the year Clark was killed in a Formula 2 race).
    

            The Brabham BT20 (and its BT19 predecessor) is unusual among F1 engineering icons because of its relative simplicity. 
    

            Having won world championships driving for Cooper in 1959 and 1960, Jack Braham decided to run a team and build his own grand prix car. 
    

            Brabham had moderate success in 1964 and 1965 but a change of engine formula for 1966 provided the perfect opportunity for the wily and pragmatic Australian.  
    

            While major manufacturers such as Ferrari and BRM chose to build complex engines specifically for the new 3-litre formula, Brabham figured that a known and uncomplicated power unit would bring immediate results while rivals found their feet. 
    

            Accordingly, he took an American Oldsmobile V8 to Repco and had the Australian engineering firm develop what had been a production unit. It may not have been as powerful as some, but it was reliable.  
    

            Initially using a BT19 (almost identical to the BT20), Brabham won four grands prix to take his third title and become the first – and in all probability – the only man to win a championship in a car bearing his own name.  
    

            Brabham’s clever strategy continued when the Brabham-Repco BT24 of his team-mate, Denny Hulme, was good enough to win the 1967 world championship.
    

            The basic profile of F1 cars was altered forever in 1970 when Chapman produced the Lotus 72.  
    

            The most striking change involved side-mounted radiators, thus making way for a wedge shape, starting with a broad chisel nose. This optimized the car’s aerodynamics; a rich, new territory for F1 designers.
    

            Unsatisfactory handling delayed the debut and prompted a major redesign of the suspension. Proof that a cure had been found came when Jochen Rindt won the car’s first grand prix in Holland. 
    

            Victories at three more races put Rindt in line for the championship but the Austrian was killed when a brake shaft snapped and sent the Lotus into the crash barrier during practice for the Italian Grand Prix. 
    

            Rindt would become the sport’s first posthumous world champion. Development of the Lotus 72 proved unsuccessful in 1971 but a further iteration brought Emerson Fittipaldi his first world title the following year. 
    

            Such was the fundamental sophistication of the car that continuing improvements ensured Lotus won the 1973 constructors’ championship, the drivers’ title being compromised by championship points split between Fittipaldi and Ronnie Peterson. 
    

            Amazingly, the Lotus 72 continued to be raced by the works team and privateers into 1975, five years after its conception.
    

            Reacting to a new rule in 1973 demanding F1 cars to have side-impact structures, McLaren chose to fully integrate these into the design rather than follow the popular trend of adding crushproof pads to the sides. 
    

            The resulting McLaren M23 had strength, simplicity and integrity throughout its wedge-shape design, although teething problems would affect the early races. 
    

            Three wins were no match for Tyrrell and Lotus in 1973 but the incorporation of lessons learned brought the drivers’ (Emerson Fittipaldi) and constructors’ titles with four victories the following year. 
    

            The M23 was substantially unaltered for 1975 when consistent finishes and three wins were not enough to beat the faster Ferraris. 
    

            McLaren continued to have faith in the design, reducing its weight and revising the suspension along with small but significant changes in readiness for 1976. 
    

            Fittipaldi’s eleventh hour departure left an opening for James Hunt, the Englishman seizing his chance with such a well-developed car. 
    

            Overcoming an early technical glitch, McLaren won six races during an epic season than ran to the wire, Hunt taking the title by a single point from Ferrari’s Niki Lauda. 
    

            The M23 had been developed through five specifications to ensure its front-line competitiveness across four seasons, making it one of F1’s most successful cars.
    

            Christened “Black Beauty” because of its elegant lines and black and gold colours, the Lotus 79 redefined F1 car design and performance. It was arguably the best of Chapman’s many flashes of genius.
    

            Searching for another unexplored advantage, the head of Lotus applied his fertile mind to harnessing the passage of air through and under the car. 
    

            The initial concept was developed throughout 1977 with the Lotus 78, the unique feature being inverted wings hidden in the sidepods that helped suck the car to the ground. 
    

            Lotus won five grands prix that year and would have been in the championship reckoning but for a number of mainly engine-related failures. 
    

            Development was helped by a rare driver/engineer empathy between Chapman and Mario Andretti (similar to the relationship with Clark). 
    

            The product of their work was the Lotus 79, a car that would refine the so-called ground effect phenomenon from the moment it first appeared in 1978. 
    

            Backed up by Ronnie Peterson, Andretti became world champion, Lotus dominating the season with eight wins to walk off with the constructors’ championship. 
    

            It was to be the height of Chapman’s ambition – and the start of a terminal decline at Lotus as the next car, the 80, was a complete flop.
    

            In September 1980, the ailing McLaren team was reformed to become McLaren International. 
    

            Technical director John Barnard, always searching for a new direction, was to make one of the biggest breakthroughs in F1 design when he abandoned the now traditional aluminium chassis in favour of one made from molded carbon fiber. 
    

            It was complex, but immensely strong and light – the two perpetual overarching aims in racing car design. Barnard also introduced a level precision and perfection hitherto unseen in racing car construction. 
    

            The McLaren MP4/1 made its debut in 1981, John Watson winning the British Grand Prix in the same year. 
    

            Watson and Niki Lauda used updated versions to win grands prix in 1982 and 1983 but the team’s competitiveness was being increasingly limited by the lack of a turbocharged engine to match those used by the competition. 
    

            Refining the same carbon fibre development, Barnard produced the MP4/2 to accept a bespoke TAG-Porsche turbo V6. 
    

            This car dominated 1984 with Lauda winning the drivers’ title by half a point from his team-mate Alain Prost in 1984, before Prost took his turn the following year. 
    

            Barnard moved to Ferrari but left behind a powerful legacy that would assist McLaren to further championships with the MP4/4.
    

            Continuing his quest for substantial innovation following his move to Ferrari, Barnard thought long and hard about how to remove the bulky manual gear lever and rod running through the right-hand side of the cockpit to the gearbox mounted at the rear. 
    

            The idea of using a semi-automatic transmission was initially linked to a push-button gear selector on the steering wheel, Barnard eventually settling for paddles behind the wheel to work in tandem with a hydraulically operated clutch. 
    

            The associated reduction in cockpit dimensions allowed a narrow chassis, a sharp, slim nose and wide sidepods to house the radiators and maximise aerodynamic efficiency. 
    

            At first, the striking appearance of the red car was not matched by reliability, persistent problems with the gearbox delaying the first race until the start of 1989 rather than, as originally planned, during the previous season. 
    

            The Ferrari 640 (also known as the F1-89) was fast but no one expected it to finish, least of Nigel Mansell as he took the V12-powered car to a remarkable win on its debut in Brazil. 
    

            A failure to finish another race until mid-season wrote off any chance of the championship, but Barnard’s innovation would change F1 transmission design forever.
    

            Williams had been working for some time on different avenues of F1 car development; semi-automatic gearboxes, traction control and active suspension. 
    

            They all came together in 1992 with the Williams FW14B, one of the most successful and arguably the most sophisticated F1 car of all time before regulatory control banned most of the complex systems involved. 
    

            The gearbox had been unreliable in 1991 but, once sorted, the driver could change gear four or five times faster without the risk of over-revving the engine. 
    

            Gradual work on active suspension – controlling the car’s ride height at a consistently efficient level – reached fruition with a switch from mechanical to a more effective electronic control, coupled with refinement of traction control. 
    

            The entire programme was overseen by technical director Patrick Head, who paid high tribute to the work of Adrian Newey as the designer packaged the multiple components into a workable and aerodynamically efficient form, coupled with a strong and powerful Renault V10 engine. 
    

            Mansell wrapped up the drivers’ championship five races before the end of the season thanks to a then record nine wins, Ricciardo Patrese’s victory in Japan and six second places helping Williams crush the opposition in the constructors’ championship.
    

            Any major change in the technical rules represents opportunity. There was none bigger in recent times than the switch from normally aspirated to hybrid turbocharged power units for 2014. 
    

            Mercedes were better prepared than most for this substantial shift in F1 thinking. 
    

            Broadly speaking, in the past a team would receive the completed power plant from a manufacturer (possibly from within their own company), install it in the chassis and go racing. 
    

            Mercedes saw the need for detailed integration of the two, the entire package created to deal with the complex requirements of associated energy recovery and its application. 
    

            The programme and detailed planning were helped by the race team being 45 minutes down the road from Mercedes High Performance Powertrains in Brixworth, Northamptonshire. 
    

            And the final key factor was Lewis Hamilton making the bold decision to leave McLaren and align his future with Mercedes. 
    

            Six wins in succession (four for Hamilton and two for Nico Rosberg) at the start of the season set a standard that would continue, not just through 2014, but across five years as the Mercedes W05 template formed the basis for one the most dominant series of cars in the history of F1."

State crackdown has also seen at least 81,000 fired or suspended

            As Turkey returns to some degree of normality following the 
, which claimed the lives of at least 240 people and 40 coup plotters, the government has wasted little time in their response. 
    

            The country’s Prime Minister Binali Yildirim quickly made public addresses denouncing the failed military uprising. While President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to seek revenge for “a clear crime of treason” in an

with mass arrests, detentions and dismissals of suspected coup plotters. Here’s a look at the numbers so far: 
    

            The purge of those alleged to have been involved in the coup has been far-wide and sweeping. Approximately 35,022 people have been detained in connection to the failed coup earlier this month, a senior official told to reporters. Of those, 11,597 detainees have since been released while 5,685 people remain in custody but have yet to go before a judge. 
    

            Previously Turkey’s interior minister Efkan Ala said the majority of the detentions have been military – 10,012 people (including 178 generals),  state broadcaster TRT reported. 
    

            

    

            In addition to the large number of detentions, around 17,740 people have been arrested on specific charges, the official added. 
    

            Turkish authorities have stripped the country’s security forces, arresting at least 5,226 military personnel, and seizing as many as 151 generals and admirals – a third of the general-rank command of the Turkish military.
    

            Additional arrests include 1,684 prosecutors and judges and 1,019 members of the police force. 
    

            1,200 troops have since been released, the government said.
    

            The country’s PM has also told state-run news agency Andalou of its intentions to disband Turkey’s elite presidential guard unit. 
    

      
      

      

    

            About 1.5% of the army were involved in the July 15 coup attempt according to a statement made by the Turkish Armed Forces, TRT reported Wednesday. 
    

            The statement also broke down the use of military inventory used by coup plotters including:
    

            

    

            Turkish authorities have issued 47 new arrest warrants for journalists, managers and former staff of the Zaman newspaper, the government said Wednesday. An official from Erdogan’s office called the newspaper “the Gulen Movement’s flagship media organization.”
    

      
      

      

    

            CNN has reached out to Zaman for comment but they had not responded by time of publishing. 
    

            This is the latest crackdown on individuals suspected of having ties to alleged coup plotters including cleric 
, whom Erdogan has repeated cited as the mastermind behind the coup attempt on July 15. Gulen lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S. and has 

    

            “The prosecutors aren’t interested in what individual columnists wrote or said. At this point, the reasoning is that prominent employees of Zaman are likely to have intimate knowledge of the Gulen network and as such could benefit the investigation,” the official said. 
    

            Previously, 
on similar grounds Tuesday. A total of 89 warrants have been issued for journalists in the country to date. Meanwhile, Turkey’s broadcasting authority has revoked licenses for 24 radio and television companies believed to have links to Gulen, Anadolu has reported. 
    

            

    

            In addition to mass arrests, Turkish 
 from various institutions, including some from state-run organizations, said Turkish PM Binali Yildirim according to Andalou. Among those affected:
    

            

    

            Turkey has closed more than 2,000 institutions they say are linked to Gulen. 
    

            
 under a new presidential decree issued in the wake of the foiled revolution. The directive also allows the government to listen in on all conversations suspects have with their legal representation. A state of emergency has also been sanctioned. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Allegations of torture and rape of coup plotters have also emerged, 
 Amnesty International says detainees face grim conditions including beatings, lack of access to food, water and lawyers amid calls for independent monitors to assess conditions. 
    

            While Erdogan’s forceful rhetoric post-coup has indicated that
 penalty, presently that is not an option. Capital punishment for peacetime crimes was outlawed in Turkey in 2002. The death penalty was completely abolished two years later as part of wider human rights reform in the country. 
    

            Turkey continues to push for entry into the European Union, but following the president’s comments, 
 made it clear any move to reintroduce capital punishment would stall these discussions.

2018-10-23T20:56:02Z,Cristiano Ronaldo shines as Juventus outclasses Manchester United,"Ronaldo returned to Old Trafford 
Manchester United 0-1 Juventus
Ronaldo instrumental in Dybala's goal

            Cristiano Ronaldo was the last player to leave the Old Trafford pitch, serenaded as he made his way to the tunnel by the Manchester United fans who had remained with a rendition of “Viva Ronaldo,” the adaptation of the Elvis riff once commonplace on these terraces a decade or so ago. 
    

            The Juventus star had not played on the ground where he first made his name since the Sir Alex Ferguson years. On this floodlit Champions League night in England’s north-west, he was warmly welcomed. 
    

            Street sellers sold scarves with his images and the words ‘The Legend Returns’ and, as he appeared for the warm-up, both sets of fans scattered inside the stadium applauded. Even after the final whistle a pitch-invader appeared to take a selfie with the former United player. He is seemingly still admired. 
    

            

    

            

    

            To the United fans who remember better times, the presence of their former No.7 and his contribution to the Italians’ 1-0 victory was a stark reminder of those Ferguson years, when winning with flair, accumulating trophies and going toe-to-toe with Europe’s most accomplished sides was routine. 
    

            Images of the Portuguese still adorn the corridors of Old Trafford, his record during his six-year spell at the club testimony as to why – 118 goals in 292 appearances, three league titles, a Champions League crown and extraordinary displays which elevated his status to the greatest the English Premier League has seen.  
    

            But things are different now. The Red Devils are not the force they were, while Ronaldo is much changed from the player who dazzled with a repertoire of tricks, wreaking havoc from the wing, mesmerizing with his invention and craft, during his United years. 
    

            Since his then world record move to Real Madrid in 2009, the forward has become more efficient and ruthless. He is one of the greatest to have played the game. 
    

            It was the 33-year-old’s cross which led to Paulo Dybala goal, securing a victory which puts Juventus in command of Group H and needing just a point to progress from the group. 
    

            Ronaldo made his Old Trafford return with a rape allegation from 2009, which the forward has strongly denied, hanging over him and this fixture. 
    

            All eyes were on the Portuguese, but he wasn’t the only player in monochrome to shine as the Italians justified their status as one of the favorites to win Europe’s premier club competition with a dominant display.
    

            The hosts had just two shots on target over 90 minutes. United came closest to scoring when Paul Pogba’s shot hit the post after the break, but a leveler would have been undeserved. 
    

            At one point in the first half, Juventus enjoyed over 75% of possession and had restricted United to just one touch inside its penalty area. The stats did not improve much for United after the break – the English club ended the night with 39% possession and manager Jose Mourinho admitting that the Italians were at a “different level.”
    

            

    

            United had no-one of Ronaldo’s ilk on the pitch, but neither did Mourinho’s men have anyone as threatening as Dybala, or as commanding as Giorgio Chiellini. No-one in red drove at the opposition like Joao Cancelo or set the tempo like Rodrigo Bentancur. 
    

            But it is Ronaldo who will dominate the headlines, because he always does. 
    

            In the opening minutes he roved around the left, drawing a foul from Ashley Young – the first of plenty during the 90 minutes – and there were flicks and backheels to remind the home supporters of those electrifying years in red.
    

            Juventus’ No.7 was free to roam wherever he sniffed danger and it was from the right wing where he caused damage in the 17th minute, his low cross from the right finding the impressive Dybala, who side-footed home for his fourth Champions League goal of the season. 
    

            The Argentine could have added to his tally in the opening 45 minutes – heading wide and drawing a save from David de Gea with a drilled effort across goal, while Ronaldo went close from distance after the break, forcing a fine fingertip save from the Spaniard.
    

            During his first few months in Turin, Ronaldo has yet to reach the standards he set in Manchester and Madrid. But he has scored five goals for his new club and in his biggest match since his summer move added much to Juventus’ attack. 
    

            In truth. for all his footballing qualities, Ronaldo was bought by the Italian champions for a club record $117 million for his global appeal off the pitch as much as his genius on it. The Italians spent big on a player entering the final chapters of his career to propel them into football’s financial big league. 
    

            According to Deloitte, Juventus is the world’s 10th richest football club – its overall income $311 million lower than Tuesday’s opponents. 
    

            The allegation that Ronaldo raped a woman in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009, now subject of both a criminal investigation and a civil suit, had not emerged when he was purchased in July. 
    

            Ronaldo has denied any wrongdoing – during Monday’s news conference he cut a relaxed figure and 
 who was certain that the truth would come out – but there has been fallout.
    

            Earlier this month 
with the allegation made against a player with whom the company has a reported billion-dollar sponsorship deal, while shares in the Serie A club have plummeted.

            However, Fred’s strike from the edge of the box in the 77th minute settled the contest and moved United up to 6th in the Premier League table. 
    

            The goal came shortly after Palace had squandered its best chance of the match when Jordan Ayew couldn’t turn a shot into the net following a corner. 
    

            “With one training session and quite a few conversations with the team … what they did today, defensively, we had full control of the game,” Rangnick 
 after the match.
    

            “Maybe one or two situations where it was a little bit dangerous, but apart from that we had full control of the game … In the end, we deserved to win,” he said.

For the 2011/2012 season, United increased revenues by £14.2 million to £117.6 million

            
 has penned a new multi-million dollar deal with U.S. insurance giant Aon as part of an aggressive marketing strategy aimed at driving revenue through sponsorship.
    

            One of 36 companies that now sponsor Manchester United, Aon will sign an eight-year contract to brand the club’s training kit and attach its name to United’s Carrington training ground. 
    

            The deal, which runs until 2021, is reportedly worth £15 million [$23 million] a season and will see the training ground renamed Aon Training Complex. 
    

            It is the first time the Premier League giants have sold the branding rights to their coveted training ground on the outskirts of Manchester and represents another step in the club’s strategy to drive up revenues.  
    

            For the 2011/2012 season, United increased revenues by £14.2 million to £117.6 million, the highest of any club in the Premier League, and have sponsorship deals with companies from Indonesian tyremakers to China Construction Bank.

: “I am delighted that this cements our relationship with Aon for a further eight years.”
    

            Additionally, the London-based insurer will act as a presenting partner for Manchester United, nicknamed the ‘Red Devils,’ on its pre-season tour of Asia this summer. Aon said ‘Tour 2013’ will focus on the Club’s 325 million followers in Asia with matches planned in Bangkok, Sydney, Yokohama, Osaka and Hong Kong.

            He added: “It is a privilege for Aon to be associated with the world-famous Manchester United training facility.” 
    

            
 anticipating that they could make more money from another sponsor. 
    

            Aon is currently the club’s main kit sponsor but is set to be replaced by Chevrolet for the start of the 2014-2015 season after the club signed a seven-year deal with the U.S. carmaker in July.

2017-06-10T01:49:58Z,"London Bridge attacker tried to rent larger truck, police say","NEW: Ringleader was out on bail in fraud case when he carried out attack
Eight people were killed when the attacked rammed a van into pedestrians

            The ringleader of the London terror attack last week tried to rent a 7.5-ton truck, British police have said, indicating the attackers were looking to carry out a larger-scale assault.
    

            Three men rammed into pedestrians on London Bridge on the night of June 3 before going on a stabbing spree at bars and restaurants at the nearby Borough Market. Eight people were killed and the three attackers were shot dead by police.  
    

      
      

      

    

            London Metropolitan Police said the trio’s ringleader, 
, attempted to rent the large truck online on the morning of June 3 but did not provide payment details when prompted.
    

            Butt rented a white Renault van in the evening instead, using a recently activated mobile phone. 
    

            

    

            Large trucks have been used in other ramming attacks in Europe and have caused higher numbers of casualties. Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel killed 86 people in Nice, France, when he plowed through a large crowd celebrating the national Bastille Day last July. In Berlin, Anis Amri rammed into a Christmas market, killing 12. 
    

            Met Police confirmed to CNN that Butt was out on bail at the time of the attacks, having been arrested in a low-level fraud offense in October 2016.
    

            He wasn’t charged and was about to be released from bail because of insufficient evidence, the police said. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Two British counter-terrorism sources told CNN that the arrest was part of a drive by British police and the MI5 intelligence agency to take known Islamist extremists “off the streets” by going after them for crimes unrelated to terrorism. That drive was initiated two years previously.
    

            An official involved in the efforts said the arrests focused on members of the pro-ISIS group al Muhajiroun and likened it to “going after Al Capone for tax evasion.”
    

            The police and other counter-terrorism agencies have come under scrutiny after it emerged that Butt was under investigation when he carried out the attack.
    

            Police have released images of three pink ceramic kitchen knives found on or near the assailants. The Ernesto brand knives are 12 inches long, and were found with tape wrapped around the handles and leather straps attached to them to keep the weapons on the attackers’ wrists.
    

            “We’ve been working round the clock to understand what these men did in the lead-up to the attack but we need to know more about these unusual knives. Where have they come from? Where might the attackers have bought them from?” the Met’s counter-terrorism command chief Dean Haydon said, calling on the public to contact police if they had any information on the weapons.
    

            Police also released photos of the van the attackers used to mow down people on the bridge.
    

            Inside, they found 13 apparent Molotov cocktails made from wine bottles and a possible flammable liquid. There also were two blowtorches. 
    

            They found a number of office chairs and a suitcase, and believe that the attackers had told family they were using the van to move as a cover story.
    

            Police said the three men – 
, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba – had driven up and down London Bridge twice before carrying out the attack, in what appears to have been a dry run.
    

      
      

      

    

            Police have conducted a series of raids in connection with the attacks and made 18 arrests. Five people remain in custody and the other 13 have been released.
    

            In a raid of an east London apartment rented by Redouane, police found an English-language copy of the Koran opened at a page describing martyrdom and materials that may have been used to make the Molotov cocktails. 
    

            Police have arrested 19 people in connection with the attack. Six men are still in custody and one has been released on bail.

2018-10-17T16:18:35Z,NFL owner pulls bid for Wembley Stadium,"The proposed £600 million ($788 million) purchase of London’s Wembley Stadium has fallen through after American businessman Shahid Khan withdrew his bid.
    

            Khan, who owns the NFL franchise Jacksonville Jaguars and English Premier League club Fulham, made the decision after his bid received criticism from some figures within English soccer.
    

            “The intent of my efforts was, and is, to do right by everyone in a manner that strengthens the English game and brings people together, not divides them,” Khan said in a statement on Wednesday. He had made his offer to England’s Football Association (FA) governing body public in April. 
    

            “I cannot rule out revisiting the opportunity at another time when perhaps the Football Association family is unified in its views on the opportunity,” Khan added.
    

      
      

      

    

            The FA had pledged to invest proceeds from the sale into the grassroots of English soccer, and Khan’s bid had received support from FA Chief Executive Martin Glenn.
    

            But former England defender Gary Neville had led criticisms of the proposal, telling a British parliamentary hearing in July that the plans were “a short-term plan we’ll regret forever.”
    

            Glenn said in a statement on Wednesday: “Mr. Khan believed that his offer to buy Wembley Stadium would release funds to help improve community football facilities in England and that it would be well received by all football stakeholders.
    

            “At a recent meeting with Mr. Khan he expressed to us that, without stronger support from within the game, his offer is being seen as more divisive than it was anticipated to be and has decided to withdraw his proposal,” Glenn added.
    

            The stadium, in the north-west of the British capital, was reopened in 2007 after a multi-million dollar rebuild. The previous site had opened in 1923 and quickly became known as the home of English football.
    

            As well as hosting home national soccer team games and other major matches, Wembley stages multiple NFL games each season – including one each year by Khan’s Jacksonville Jaguars.
    

            Wembley’s proposed purchase had been seen by many as a key move in the potential future relocation of an NFL team to London, though Khan repeatedly denied that he was intending to move the Jaguars abroad.
    

            Pakistani-born Khan is the 217th richest person in the world, according to Forbes, having made his money by developing auto parts.
    

            In 2013 he bought Fulham, a London-based soccer club that was promoted back into the Premier League in May by winning a play-off final at Wembley.
    

            Khan will be expected to watch the Jaguars when they face the Philadelphia Eagles at the stadium on October 28."

, his troops are seeing 
 and US President Joe Biden just 
, but for Russian President Vladimir Putin, everything is still going to plan.  
    

            In remarks this week, Putin has shown no hint of introspection, spinning Russia’s pariah status on the international stage as a sort of victory.  
    

            Take his remarks in a virtual meeting on Russia’s development of the Arctic. Western oil companies may be abandoning ventures in Russia, 
, Biden has slapped a 
 and the EU, though far from going cold turkey, is 
.
    

            Putin’s take? The pain inflicted on European energy consumers is a good thing, and Russia will find other markets. 
    

            “The refusal by a number of Western countries to engage in normal cooperation, including with Russian energy resources … is hitting millions of Europeans,” he said. “It’s sparked a real energy crisis.  It’s being reflected also in the United States. Everywhere inflation, prices are rising.”  
    

      
      

      

    

            To be sure, Putin continued, “even we are encountering problems, but for us alternative opportunities, options, new windows of opportunity are opening up.” 
    

            That sort of glass-half-full message may be meant to reassure uneasy Russians. But Putin is also presenting a blithe confidence about how the war in Ukraine is going, despite massive setbacks in the effort to “denazify” Ukraine – the Kremlin leader’s ugly shorthand for overthrowing the democratically-elected government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and ending Ukrainian statehood as we know it. 
    

            On Tuesday, Putin paid a visit to the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the Russian Far East, where he had a Cosmonautics Day photo opportunity with his partner in autocracy, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.  
    

            In remarks at the event, Putin dismissed widespread evidence of atrocities in the Ukrainian town of Bucha in the wake of the withdrawal of Russian troops, comparing them to “fake” reports about the use of chemical weapons in Syria by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.    
    

            “There were provocations in Syria, when the use of chemical weapons by the Assad government was planted. Then it turned out that it was fake, the same fake is in Bucha,” he said. 
    

            The US and Western governments reported multiple instances of the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, with the White House saying the Assad regime had crossed a “red line” with the 
. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded Assad’s forces were also responsible for a series of 
 in late March 2017.
    

      
      

      

    

            Putin singing the fake-news refrain is not new. But the Russian President did signal something substantial, saying during the same event that peace talks with Ukraine had hit “a dead end” and vowing that he “will not stop military operations” in Ukraine until his campaign succeeds. 
    

            What Putin’s real measure of success is remains anyone’s guess. 
    

            Some observers – and Western officials – have suggested his generals have a plan to press a big offensive in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, so they can present some evidence of tangible progress on the battlefield to their leader ahead of May 9, when Russia observes the Victory Day holiday. 
    

            If that deadline is real, then the clock is definitely ticking for Putin’s commanders.   
    

            Whether negotiations are indeed at a dead end is another matter. 
    

            Following Putin’s remarks, Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine and a lead negotiator in the Russia-Ukraine talks, countered that “
 Online in working subgroups. But they are ongoing.”  
    

            But Podolyak also suggested another factor: Unlike Russia’s political system, which is subject to the whims of one man, Ukraine’s government must contend with widespread outrage at the uncovering of widespread killings of civilians by Russian troops. 
    

            That will make the task of talking peace with Putin even harder."

He told CNN on Sunday that his forces lack the firepower to hit an airplane so high up.
    

            The Ukraine crisis has its roots in former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to shun a European Union association agreement last year and work with Russia instead.

            Belgian special operations forces, clad in balaclavas and with bomb disposal robots at the ready, cordoned off two streets as they raided a property in Molenbeek, a suburb of the Belgian capital, on Monday morning, according to a CNN team at the scene.
    

            Jean-Pascal Thoreau, a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor, later told CNN that no one was arrested in the raid.
    

            

    

            Earlier, Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing the country’s Federal Justice Department, had reported that police had made one arrest during the raid, but had not apprehended Salah Abdeslam, the French citizen at the center of a manhunt for his suspected involvement in the terror attacks.

            After the Verviers plot was foiled, Abaaoud evaded European authorities’ efforts to apprehend him. He later was featured in an ISIS propaganda magazine, claiming to have returned to Syria.
    

            

    

            Geens, the Belgian justice minister, told CNN on Monday that the jurisdictional divisions in the Brussels police force could hamper police efforts against the jihadist threat.  Brussels has 19 municipal mayors in charge of six police zones with their own local police forces.
    

            “The fact that Brussels is politically and – as to its police forces – a little bit more divided than one would expect from such a big city creates additional problems as to surveillance,” he told CNN’s Watson.
    

            “The main thing is the local and federal police have to work together continuously. Simple and normal criminality which has nothing to do with terrorism – but like false papers, false passports, weapon trade – are flourishing in certain suburbs of Brussels like in Molenbeek, and we absolutely have to counter these things with the help of local services.”
    

            In 
 in August, Alain Grignard, a senior member of the counterterror unit in the Brussels federal police and a lecturer on political 
 at the University of Liege, said the perpetrators of the Verviers plot fit a typical profile of Belgian jihadists: “men in their early 20s mostly from the Molenbeek district of Brussels moving in circles with a track record of delinquency and petty crime.” 
    

            “They were radicalized very quickly, and when they came back from Syria they had no fear of death,” Grignard 
, published in the 
’s publication, the CTC Sentinel. Cruickshank is also editor-in-chief of the CTC Sentinel.
    

            “These guys had maybe more experience in gun battles than our own commandos.”
    

            Like many European jihadists, they were an outgrowth of the “inner-city gang phenomenon,” he said, who had already revolted against Western society through petty crime and delinquency before having their antisocial approach “legitimized” by a radical strain of Islam.
    

      
      

      

    

            “These youngsters are getting quickly and completely sucked in. The next thing they know they’re in Syria and in a real video game,” he said.
    

            He told Cruickshank that the terror threat in Belgium, fueled by the trail of young jihadists to fight in Syria and Iraq, had “never been higher in all the years I’ve been working on counterterrorism.” 
    

            “To give you an idea of the scale of the challenge, in the past two years we’ve charged more people with terrorism offenses than in the 30 years before that,” he said. “It’s impossible to do surveillance on everybody.”
    

            Since 2012, he said, al Qaeda had been “trying to talent spot” Western jihadists on the battlefields of Syria for use in potential operations against the West, while ISIS had appeared more focused on state building. But since the start of the U.S.-led air campaign targeting ISIS, the concern had grown that ISIS would also focus on directly targeting Western countries. 
    

            “And the worry is that competition between al Qaeda and the Islamic State will see both groups try to outdo each other with attacks in the West,” he said.

2021-06-04T04:00:17Z,N/A,"at a cafe in the quiet English city of Gloucester revived a half-century-old puzzle: What happened to Mary Bastholm, a carefree 15-year-old girl who went missing in 1968.
    

            The teenager has long been feared to be among the victims murdered by Fred West, but her body has never been found. 
    

            West and his wife Rosemary, who met the following year, would go on to become Britain’s worst serial killer couple. 
    

            A week-long dig, at the Clean Plate cafe in the heart of the historic city, resulted in the discovery of “
” according to police; but the search has stirred up painful memories. 
    

            More than 25 years have passed since the UK was shocked by the grim discovery of multiple sets of human remains in what had appeared to be a nondescript family home in Gloucester. But too many questions remain unanswered for the public’s fascination with the case to end, or for the city to rest easy.
    

            Fred West was charged with 12 counts of murder, though there have long been suspicions that other young women and girls were abducted, tortured, sexually abused and killed by the Wests. Fred killed himself age 53 before he could stand trial, taking many secrets to his grave. 
    

            Rosemary, known as Rose, was convicted on 10 counts of murder in November 1995; she will remain in prison until she dies. She has always protested her innocence and has revealed nothing about the case over the years.
    

            Adding to the horror is that those killed include family members: Charmaine West, Fred’s 8-year-old stepdaughter from his first marriage to Catherine “Rena” Costello, and Heather West, 16, his eldest child with Rosemary.
    

            It was Heather’s death in 1987 – believed to be the final murder carried out by the pair – that was to lead police to uncovering the mutilated remains of victims at four different sites in the following decade.
    

            What many still wonder is how the killers got away with it for so long.
    

            Most of the couple’s victims were killed in the 1970s. But it was only in August 1992, when the Wests’ five remaining children were taken into local authority care because of child abuse allegations against their parents, that “the whole dreadful, murky business started to unravel,” Leo Goatley, a Gloucester-based solicitor who represented Rose West from 1992 until 2004, told CNN.
    

            It was a history “that went back over decades and involved the abduction, sado-masochistic torture and binding of innocent young women, who were then murdered and dismembered and their bodies buried,” said Goatley, author of the book “Understanding Fred and Rose West: Noose, Lamella and the Gilded Cage.”
    

            “It had and continues to have an enormous impact on the people of Gloucester. It’s a cloud over the ancient city.”
    

            Heather West had last been seen on June 19, 1987, but she was never reported missing to police. Over the course of months, social workers caring for her five siblings began to take note of their repeated – though reportedly offhand – mentions of the “family joke” that their sister was buried under the patio. In summer 1993, the police were told of these concerns.
    

            Six months later – having found no trace of Heather alive – officers from the Gloucestershire Constabulary obtained a warrant to search 25 Cromwell Street, the Wests’ family home since 1972.
    

            Fred West at first claimed he had seen Heather recently. But a day later, on February 25, 1994, he admitted to killing her, according to a 
 of events. He and Rose were arrested the same day.
    

            As police questioning continued – with Fred repeatedly changing his story and Rose denying any knowledge – investigators uncovered a femur in the garden. When a pathologist then found two more femurs under the patio, later identified as belonging to Heather, police knew they could have multiple murders on their hands.
    

            Fred confessed on February 26 to killing two more women, one named Shirley Robinson, 18, and another subsequently identified by police as Alison Chambers, 16. The remains of both were later found in the garden.
    

            On March 4, West passed a handwritten note to his solicitor saying: “I wish to admit to a further (approx) nine killings expressly Charmaine, Rena, Lynda Gough and others to be identified.”
    

            Within hours, West had been taken back to 25 Cromwell Street by police, where he pointed out spots where more bodies had been concealed. 
    

            Remains later identified as those of Swiss student Therese Siegenthaler, 21, Shirley Hubbard, 15, Lucy Partington, 21, Juanita Mott, 18, and 15-year-old Carole Ann “Caz” Cooper
were subsequently found in the basement of the house. The remains of Lynda Gough, 19, were uncovered in the bathroom area. 
    

            Over the course of 11 fevered days, nine victims had been found in one drab end-of-terrace family home.
    

            And as investigators dug, newspaper reports and live TV broadcasts kept a repulsed but fascinated public abreast of every move.
    

            Journalist Chris Summers, who worked for the Gloucester Citizen newspaper at the time, recalls being tipped off as excavations at Cromwell Street began and poring through old cuttings and local records to find out who lived in the house. Events quickly snowballed.
    

    

            “It was a massive, massive story,” said Summers, who now runs the 
 website from London. “The whole of Fleet Street came down, Sky and BBC TV trucks. Within a couple of weeks there were TV crews from Japan and America, all over the place. Fleet Street was waving their checkbooks around … and getting a lot of people to talk. We were trying to compete as the local paper.”
    

            Criminologist Jane Carter Woodrow, whose book “Rose West: The Making of a Monster” was published in 2012, recalls not wanting to watch on TV as black boxes containing human remains were carried out of the house. But for weeks the story dominated the headlines. 
    

            “I think people have an awful fear, but a kind of a fascination, how could this happen? Who could do this kind of thing? It was just awful,” said Carter Woodrow. “There were lots of missing girls and gradually, one by one, people’s remains were coming out – it was just unbelievable, really.”
    

            Details which emerged later revealed the couple were “sexually sadistic” killers, Carter Woodrow told CNN.
    

            The bodies were found dismembered, stuffed into vertical holes in the ground and with “trophy” parts – such as kneecaps and finger bones – removed which have never been found.
    

            Unlike the other victims, Heather was killed because she posed a threat, Carter Woodrow said. She’d started to talk to friends about Fred’s sexual abuse of some of his children and had announced plans to run away.
    

            The search at 25 Cromwell Street was to last for 55 days; the property was subsequently demolished.
    

            In late April of 1994, the focus shifted to nearby 25 Midland Road, where Fred and Rose had lived in the early 1970s with Charmaine and Anne Marie, Fred’s daughter with Costello. Both children had been in and out of local authority care in the late 1960s before being returned to Fred. 
    

            On May 4, police found the remains of Charmaine beneath the kitchen. Rosemary had murdered the 8-year-old in June 1971 while Fred was in prison for theft; on his release, he helped her conceal the body. Charmaine was never reported missing.
    

            Fred had also led police 17 miles or so out of the city to a field in the village of Kempley – near his birthplace of Much Marcle – where Costello’s remains were found in April. The remains of West’s former nanny and pregnant mistress, Ann McFall, were recovered in June from a field nearby. Despite denying involvement in her death, Fred indicated the area where she was buried. 
    

            Since then, no remains have been found. But both Carter Woodrow and Goatley believe there are more bodies out there.
    

            “The experts, the forensic psychologists, believe that the pair of them, Fred and Rose West, would have continued rather than to have big gaps between one (victim) and another,” Goatley said.
    

            When Fred was found dead in his remand cell on January 1, 1995, reaction in Gloucester was mixed, according to Summers. While some felt relief because “they wanted this shameful person wiped off the face of the earth,” others – particularly the victims’ relatives – felt they’d been cheated of justice, he said.
    

            “It was felt that he did it in an attempt to get Rose off. He thought that if he could kill himself … she could then pin it all on him. Obviously that didn’t work,” Summers said. 
    

            Ten months later, Rosemary stood trial at Winchester Crown Court on 10 counts of murder. 
    

            The trial was “pretty dramatic” the whole way through, in Summers’ recollection. One woman who was a neighbor of the Wests and had been in a relationship with Rose told the court that she kept going back to 25 Cromwell Street because she was drawn “like a moth to a flame,” Summers said.
    

            An audio recording was played in court of the police interview in which Fred described how his daughter Heather was killed, dismembered and buried in the garden. “It was just bizarre,” said Summers. “He was very, very matter-of-fact. He could have been talking about burying a dead hamster.”
    

            Rose gave no outward reaction as the guilty verdict was delivered, said Summers. “I think she probably knew what was coming.”
    

            She lost her appeal against the conviction in 1996 and, the following year, her life sentence was converted to a “whole-life” tariff.
    

            Despite the trial, the public was left with many unanswered questions – about both the Wests’ victims and whether public bodies had missed opportunities to halt the appalling cycle of abuse, incest and murder years earlier.
    

            A report 
 into how its agencies served the West children, published in 1995, highlighted the need for teachers, doctors, social workers and police “not to dismiss lightly the comments of children (however apparently bizarre),” and for different bodies to communicate. But at least one newspaper described it as 
.
    

            The murders also highlighted how many young women and girls had gone missing in previous decades. Overall, 110 missing people were found to be safe and well as a result of the West inquiry, according to Gloucestershire Constabulary.
    

            Some of those killed by the Wests came from vulnerable backgrounds. The couple targeted local children’s homes in search of girls to entice to 25 Cromwell Street, according to Carter Woodrow. Others are believed to have been abducted while waiting at bus stops or as they hitchhiked between towns.
    

            Even when they were reported missing, inquiries soon ran out of steam.
    

            “A lot of the victims were in care or had absconded or run away from home, and they were victims that disappeared. They were anonymous, and no one knew they were missing,” said Goatley.
    

            “It’s one of the horrible things about the case that there are so many question marks, so much unknown,” he added.
    

            “Even in the West case, in the trial, where identities were established, it was never entirely clear what fate befell those women and those young girls. It’s known that they were abducted, it’s known that the quality of their lives in their last days would have been appalling … It’s a nightmare trying to speculate about precisely what did happen to those girls.”
    

            Police would have carried on investigating after the West inquiry formally concluded in 1996 but for a lack of resources, said Goatley. “There hadn’t been any fresh evidence, so they had to draw a line somewhere.”
    

            Carter Woodrow believes the Wests’ actions went undetected for so long in part because “they looked like a very ordinary couple” – but that their depraved actions had roots in their childhoods. 
    

            “They’d both been subjected to incest, and they both had abused as well, so when they both met it was the worst possible combination,” she said. 
    

            “There’s no doubt Fred West was a sadist and a voyeur, and a serial killer, a psychopath with a very warped sexual mind. And Rose West was his willing apprentice,” said Goatley. 
    

            “She had this Jekyll and Hyde personality. She could vent a fury that was absolutely appalling, I mean her children can vouch for that. Her vile anger may have even surpassed the level of sadistic action by Fred West in relation to these victims. So it was a really toxic, horrible cocktail.”
    

            As her legal representative, Goatley spent hundreds of hours with Rose between 1992 and 2004, including on prison visits. 
    

            Rose “presents [as] and in many ways is just very ordinary,” he said. “She would chat away about sewing or whatever, talk about the kids and it’s all very mundane and twee and having a laugh.” But Goatley said he saw flashes of anger if the conversation strayed into more difficult territory.
    

            He still hopes Rose, now 67, might one day break her silence. “I’m sure that, one way or another, she knows an awful lot more than she’s letting on. You just hope that she might reach some state of mind where she might give an explanation or an admission, or provide some information,” he said.
    

            Meanwhile, the case has cast a long shadow over Gloucester and its roughly 120,000 residents.
    

            Before the West story broke in 1994, it was a “bit of a forgotten town,” said Summers, ignored by tourists in favor of nearby well-heeled Cheltenham. “Obviously it became part of this kind of morbid tourist trail when the murders happened.”
    

            Even today, it sometimes seems the West case has left hardly anyone in the city untouched, said Goatley. “There’s always somebody who has some story or link or knowledge about the West case … The way it kind of radiates out is extraordinary. It’s almost as though the case envelops a sizable percentage of the population of Gloucester in some way – and emotionally it does, emotionally I think it grabs everyone.”
    

            The unresolved questions over Mary Bastholm’s disappearance mean there is still no peace for her family and those who knew her. 
    

            Her parents and more recently her brother, Peter, went to their grave without knowing her fate. The teenager’s wider family are still without closure now police are certain she wasn’t buried beneath the cafe where she once worked.
    

            “Everyone working on this is disappointed that we didn’t find Mary,” said Assistant Chief Constable Craig Holden on Thursday. “Allowing her family to finally lay Mary to rest after over 50 years was always the most important reason for our excavation.” 
    

            “I hope that eliminating this location will bring some comfort, however small, to her family.”"
2022-02-16T18:12:32Z,"Ukraine cyberattack is largest of its kind in country’s history, says official","A high-volume 
 that temporarily blocked access to the websites of 
 defense agencies and banks on Tuesday was “the largest [such attack] in the history of Ukraine,” according to a government minister.
    

            Speaking at a press conference Wednesday, Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine Mykhailo Fedorov added that it is too early to tell who was responsible for the attack.
    

            The so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack – which bombarded Ukrainian websites with phony traffic – was coordinated and well planned, officials said. 
    

            DDoS attacks often disrupt access to IT systems, but their impact can be more psychological rather than having any direct effect on a country’s critical infrastructure.
    

            While down for parts of Tuesday, the websites of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces, and those of two prominent banks, were back up Wednesday, according to CNN journalists in Ukraine. The DDoS attack, however, is ongoing, Ukrainian officials said.
    

            The incident comes as Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops close to Ukraine’s border, according to US President Joe Biden, and as US officials warn that a fresh Russian invasion could come at any time. Russia has denied it is planning to invade Ukraine.
    

            The US government is investigating the cyberattack on Ukrainian websites, a top State Department official said Wednesday, while suggesting that Russia has a history of carrying out such hacks.
    

      
      

      

    

            “But who is best at this, who uses this weapon all around the world? Obviously, the Kremlin,” Undersecretary of State Toria Nuland said on CBS This Morning.
    

            “While we’re still investigating and doing forensics along with the Ukrainians, I think what’s most important is that these cyberattacks were not very successful,” Nuland said. She credited Ukrainian officials for responding quickly and helping the websites recover. 
    

            Internet traffic hitting Ukrainian websites during the DDoS attack was “three orders of magnitude more than regularly observed traffic,” according to data collected by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. 
    

            Ninety-nine percent of the traffic involved a type of digital request to computer servers, “indicating the attackers were attempting to overwhelm Ukrainian servers,” said Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s senior vice president of intelligence.
    

            A Ukrainian intelligence report recently obtained by CNN pointed to Russia’s effort to destabilize “Ukraine’s internal situation by using economic, energy, information, cyber, social, ethnic, and other tools.”
    

      
      

      

    

            Ukraine has concluded that Russia and Belarus were responsible for a separate cyberattack that hit government websites last month. 
    

            “As a result of a massive hacker attack on the night of January 14, 2022, the web pages of the Government of Ukraine” were shut down. The attacks were carried out by a group affiliated with the Russian and Belarusian special services,” the Ukrainian intelligence report said.
    

            Similarities in the infrastructure used in Tuesday’s DDoS attack and the one last month suggest the incidents could be connected, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday.
    

            In mid-January scores of Ukrainian government websites were targeted in a cyberattack with threatening text warning Ukrainians to “be afraid and wait for the worst,” and alleging their personal information had been hacked.
    

            Ukraine claimed Russia was most likely behind the attack, which affected the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies.

2017-07-11T12:38:55Z,From being paralyzed by shame to coaching Serena Williams,"Mouratoglou has been Williams' coach for five years
Williams has won 10 grand slams with Frenchman

            Patrick Mouratoglou likes stress. He craves it. The man Serena Williams credits for taking her from “great to history” is not one to rest. He can’t. Boredom would quickly smother the Frenchman were he to ever take it easy. 
    

            The 47-year-old’s pulse used to quicken when he would watch Williams, one of history’s greatest champions, compete. That was pressure. That was adrenaline. He loved it.
    

            But with his pupil on maternity leave, deep into her third trimester, the coach has to now find the buzz, the rush, from elsewhere, though nothing can truly compare to helping Williams rewrite the record books. 
    

            Even live television interviews do not make the heart race, for the Parisian is as comfortable on screen as the rest of us would be sunbathing on a beach.
    

            “You can check my pulse before and after, I am the same,” he says, fresh from a live appearance on a British breakfast television programme. 
    

            “I find a way to have stress because I need it. I did TV during the French Open and I told the guy ‘make me do things I’ve never done before.’”
    

            This summer marks his fifth as Williams’ coach and so, naturally, he has become accustomed to the attention that comes with working alongside the world’s most recognizable female athlete, a player who has danced in a Beyonce music video and been a tennis superstar for almost two decades.
    

            Once describing being afraid as a “disaster,” Mouratoglou also has no fear, which was a useful trait when confronted by Williams’ father, Richard, shortly after the 23-time grand slam champion had appointed the Frenchman as her coach. 
    

            Never before had the American worked with someone not sanctioned by her family. The father, the engineer behind Serena and sister Venus’ success, needed to be swayed. He was quickly converted and Williams’ decision to broaden her horizons proved to be a masterstroke. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Mouratoglou can list Williams’ achievements since their partnership began as easily as someone ordering takeaway from a favorite restaurant: 10 grand slam titles, two Olympic golds and a three-and-a-half year stint at the top of the world rankings.
    

            But both he and Williams, he says, are the same characters they were before their alliance. 
    

            “I don’t think she’s changed me or I’ve changed her,” Mouratoglou, who describes himself as a person of extremes, tells CNN. 
    

            “I have more exposure clearly than before, but it’s also deserved because we did so well.
    

            “When you’re with Serena you have a lot of exposure, people look at you different, probably. I’m not saying that they should, but it’s a normal process.”
    

            

    

            

    

            

    

            It is just before midday on a glorious London summer’s day and Mouratoglou has already been interviewed 15 times in the last 24 hours, a number that will only increase in the hours ahead as he promotes his autobiography “The Coach,” which is now available in English. 
    

            He has had little sleep. His lack of shut-eye, he says, is a combination of boundless media commitments and late-night socializing with friends in England’s capital.
    

            He gladly accepts a cup of so-so office-made coffee, although outwardly he doesn’t appear to need an injection of caffeine. Wearing a jacket, white shirt and a pocket square, he is the personification of exemplary Gallic tailoring. 
    

            And though 30 minutes early for the interview, he doesn’t use the spare time to pause. Instead, the loquacious Frenchman is happy to talk at length about Williams – her pregnancy, her return – and his rise from an anxious, unhappy child to one of tennis’ best coaches. 
    

            This is a strange time for the father-of-four. He is at Wimbledon with no student to teach, but this summer, he says, is just the interval before one of the sport’s most successful partnerships resumes next year. 
    

            Mouratoglou did not know Williams was pregnant during the Australian Open in January, a tournament she won without dropping a set, but the news did not come as a surprise because the player had, he says, been looking forward to becoming a mother “for quite a long time.”
    

            Ever since Williams announced in May that she was pregnant, the 35-year-old –  the oldest player to ever be a world No.1, the most relentless accumulator of grand slam titles in nearly 50 years – has maintained she will play tennis competitively again.
    

            She is a woman who thinks “everything is possible,” says Mouratoglou. 
    

            “Serena with a baby is still Serena,” he continues. “I know she will need time because I know it’s a trauma for the body, but we’ll take the time. 
    

            “It’s a new situation but when I see how determined she is at the moment to come back, I’d be really surprised if she changed her mind.”
    

      
      

      

    

            By posting videos on social media of practice sessions at her Miami home, the mum-to-be has been showing the world her steadfast desire to make a comeback and last month flew to Paris to make plans with Mouratoglou for her return. 
    

            “She wanted to ask me a lot of things – what would be the team and when we would start,” Mouratoglou explains.
    

            “My job is called adaptation. It’s always about adapting to new situations, but the core team is going to be the same. It’s just extra people, like a nanny, but even if they come to the court, it’s fine, we’ll adapt.
    

            “She’s incredibly happy and she’s frustrated at the same time because she wants to compete. 
    

            “She’s playing every day. She doesn’t move around the court, she just wants to keep contact with the ball and that’s it.”
    

            It was Williams who, in 2012, picked up the phone and called Mouratoglou to ask if she could use the facilities at his academy on the outskirts of France’s capital. He has recently opened another academy in Nice. 
    

            Williams had just suffered a surprise first-round defeat at the French Open and two years had passed since she had won a grand slam title. Confidence was low. 
    

            Mouratoglou’s strategy was to shift this once-in-a-generation talent’s focus onto records, onto building a legacy.
    

            He introduced top spin to her forehand, made her play longer rallies and made sure his charge was mentally prepared for games, formulating tactics for each opponent, using his words carefully to inspire. 
    

            “It’s the little differences,” he says. “When players think right it makes a huge difference and, with champions, it’s even bigger. She can completely switch from one second to another.”
    

      
      

      

    

            The girl from Compton kept going, even though she was already at an age where many retire, and is now one short of equaling Margaret Court’s all-time singles record of 24 grand slams. She is a sporting icon. But what makes Williams a great champion, Mouratoglou explains, is her state of “permanent non-satisfaction.” 
    

            Victories are forgotten, new goals are quickly set. She works as hard to maintain her greatness as she did to achieve it and, crucially, refuses to accept defeat. This is a player who has won three of her grand slam singles titles after being match point down. 
    

            Mouratolgou remembers Williams’ victory at the French Open final in 2013, a tournament she had not won for 11 years. 
    

            “After the trophy ceremony she looks at me and says ‘I want to win Wimbledon,’” he recalls, still impressed by her grit. 
    

            “There was zero celebration and, believe me, we tried. We were in the car and she just said ‘drive me home.’”
    

            Mouratoglou is the son of a Greek-born businessman, but despite his family’s wealth he remembers his childhood as one of being “paralyzed by the shame of not being able to do better.”
    

            An anxious, shy, “puny” kid, his early years were a “disaster,” which makes his evolution into an exceptional communicator all the more remarkable. 
    

            “I couldn’t connect with people so I developed other senses. I had no other option,” says Mouratolgou, who grew from an academic under-achiever into a talented singer and jazz guitarist, though tennis was his passion. 
    

            “I had to make those changes in order to live the life I wanted to live. Now, from my point of view, I have the ideal life.”
    

            How long will that life involve coaching Williams not even he knows. 
    

            “One day she will wake up and she will tell me ‘I don’t feel like going to practice tomorrow.’ She’ll say the same the day after, the week after, and then she’ll tell me it’s game over, but when that is going to be I have no idea,” he says.
    

            What Mouratoglu is sure of, however, is that Williams will be aiming to win grand slams when she returns to the sport. 
    

            “The goal is not to beat this record, or that record, the real goal is to set up Serena’s record. Is it 23? 24? 25? 30? I don’t know, but let’s go, let’s find out.
    

            “Why would there be a limit? If, as a coach, I set limits for Serena I’m really a terrible coach because Serena doesn’t have limits.”
    

            

    

            She might not have played since the Australian Open final, but Williams is still making headlines.
    

            First her pregnancy caused waves, then she appeared naked on the front cover of Vanity Fair, and recently she’s been involved in a spat with compatriot John McEnroe. 
    

            The three-time Wimbledon champion said Williams would be “about 700 in the world” were she on the men’s tour. While others debated the matter, Williams responded on social media, asking the former world No.1 to respect her privacy.
    

      
      

      

    

            There has not been an interview where Mouratoglou has not been asked about the outspoken New Yorker’s comments.
    

            “He didn’t mean to hurt her, of course, but it’s hurtful and I understand her reaction,” he says. “It’s basically saying women’s tennis is not good. But one comment does not make a sport sexist.”
    

            At pain to emphasize he is not specifically referring to McEnroe, Mouratoglou, who has also coached on the men’s tour, criticizes those who habitually compare men’s and women’s tennis. 
    

            “It’s true women don’t run as fast, they don’t jump as high but because of that does it make their tour not interesting? I don’t think so, it’s just another tour,” he says. 
    

            

    

            “You have to see women’s and men’s tennis as different sports because women have different qualities. I don’t understand why people compare, it doesn’t make sense to me. 
    

            “The message is – it’s not as good as men. OK, if you don’t like it, don’t watch it. You don’t have to make a comment. Let the people who like it, like it.”"
2023-02-28T15:11:38Z,French Football Federation president Noël Le Graët resigns,"Embattled French 
 Federation (FFF) president 
has resigned, the federation announced in 
.
    

            “Noël Le Graët announced today to the Executive Committee of the French Football Federation his decision to leave his position,” the FFF said in the statement.
    

            It added: “The FFF would like to salute the remarkable sporting and economic results of Noël Le Graët.”
    

            FFF vice president Philippe Diallo has been announced as the interim president until June 10, 2023, the date of the next federation meeting.
    

            Le Graët has been president of the FFF since 2011 and his mandate was due to run until 2024.
    

            Last month, the 81-year-old chose to step down from his role as president “until the completion of the audit performed by the sports ministry.”
    

            According to 
, the audit said that Le Graët had displayed “inappropriate behaviour … towards women” and that he no longer had the “necessary legitimacy” to work in French sport. 
    

            Le Graët has denied any wrongdoing, Reuters reported. CNN has contacted his lawyers and the FFF for further comment. 
    

            Last month, Le Graët also drew the ire of players and politicians for comments about French legend Zinedine Zidane.
    

            In an interview with radio station RMC in January, Le Graët said he “wouldn’t even have taken [a] call” from Zidane when asked whether the World Cup winner had called to express an interest in taking over as the men’s national team coach from Didier Deschamps.
    

            He later 
 for the remarks.
    

            Le Graët has been credited with reviving the French team having been in charge of the FFF when Les Bleus won the World Cup in 2018 and lost in the final against Argentina last year.
    

            But he also has a record of making controversial comments, 
 in 2019 that he is “totally against” the interruption of football matches as a result of homophobic chants and banners.
    

            “I would not stop the games. I do not want to be held hostage on homophobia. There are security services to ensure that these banners disappear,” Le Graët told radio station France Info at the time.

2018-12-20T17:23:52Z,Hines Ward: Making a playoff push is the NFL dream,"I’ve always said this year has kind of been, really, the year of the quarterbacks. Drew Brees becoming the all-time leading passer, Tom Brady’s still doing his thing at the age of 41. But I kind of see the young guns, the young quarterbacks that are rising.
    

            My Steelers won Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, but the following season we ended up missing the playoffs despite winning the last three games, finishing 9-7 and not losing a single game by more than six points. It’s a letdown because you know you still have the talent in place and the ingredients to find success. But on the flip side, you realize what a blessing it is to get a chance in the first place. 
    

            I’ve played with guys who never even came close to making the playoffs. 
    

            Playing in the playoffs and really making that push towards a Super Bowl is really what we live for as football players. It’s what we get paid for and, honestly, I know a lot of people that would do it for free. That’s what you dreamed about when you were a little kid, because there’s nothing like playing in the Super Bowl. 
    

            It was hard for us, because when you’re in those last few weeks, you want to control your own destiny. You don’t want to have to worry about needing help to get into the playoffs, hoping other teams lose and worrying about whether other teams are going to end up resting players because they have their spot already locked up. It’s hard to not take a peek up at that scoreboard while you’re playing and see what else is going on. 
    

            You can kind of see the similarities with the Eagles this year. They still have a lot of their key pieces from their Super Bowl run and win, but they’ve been struggling to keep things consistent. They’ve got a sense of urgency because they know the temperature is getting hotter, especially because they know they have to win out and still get a little bit of help along the way. 
    

            They’re still a good team, just like we were still a good team in 2009-10 (we ended up making the Super Bowl that next year). For the Eagles to have been able to beat the Rams last week, that’s impressive, especially on the road. When it comes to Nick Foles, the guy’s just been able to get it done in Philly. The team rallies around him, so we’ll see if he’s able to pull off some of the same magic as last year. 
    

            That’s the fun and uniqueness of making a playoff push. Teams that control their own destiny, kudos to them for getting it done. And if you’re one of those teams where your season is going to come down to the last weekend, it makes for an exciting ride. 
    

            
 It seems like they’re on the verge of getting over the hump and they’ve got plenty of young talent around them. They’ve already won more games this season than they have in the last three years. 
    

            
There was so much pressure on him, from being a Heisman winner to being the top pick, to Cleveland having looked for a quarterback for so long. I love what he brings to the table. I love that he’s – I wouldn’t say cocky, but confident. You want a quarterback who has that moxie, because when you’re in the huddle, everybody else builds off that."
2015-03-25T11:33:06Z,Jackie Stewart: Fernando Alonso will have ‘no trouble at all’ on comeback,"Fernando Alonso will have “no trouble at all” as he targets a return to Formula One at the Malaysia Grand Prix after his freakish crash in winter testing.
    

            The McLaren driver 
on the advice of his doctors but will drive in Sunday’s race if he passes a medical assessment by the sport’s governing body, the FIA, at the Sepang circuit on Thursday.
    

            Jackie Stewart, a three-time world champion and leading motorsport safety campaigner, told CNN: “Alonso will deal with that, no trouble at all. 
    

            “He’s probably got the best head of any racing driver right now. 
    

            “Racing drivers always have accidents of some kind and come back very resilient and better trained. Their physical condition is very good and they are better prepared for racing today than in the history of the sport.”
    

            Alonso is renown for his mental strength and the Spanish double world champion has also posted regular updates on social media describing his physical training, including photos of him pumping iron, in the build up to Malaysia.
    

            The CNN-sponsored McLaren team said since his testing accident in Barcelona he has “followed a rigorous, specialized training program… to ensure his safe and timely return to racing.”
    

            Alonso was 
after losing control of his McLaren at the penultimate winter test at Barcelona’s Circuit de Catalunya on February 22.
    

            The 33-year-old watched the Melbourne race from his home in Dubai after doctors indicated returning to racing three weeks after a high impact crash was too risky.
    

            McLaren said senior engineers discussed the accident with Alonso when he visited the team’s headquarters outside London last week. 
    

            The team said in a statement: “While there was nothing evident in the extensive car telemetry data, nor anything abnormal in the subsequent reconstructions and laboratory tests, Fernando recalls a sense of ‘heavy’ steering prior to the accident.”
    
Sir Jackie Stewart has been in the spotlight for 
 today 

            Stewart believes Alonso and his team made the right decision not to race in Australia, even though it meant delaying the star driver’s return to the McLaren cockpit after five years with Ferrari.
    

            “I don’t have any doubt at all that his doctors did exactly the right thing and that he had made the right decision personally to follow the instructions of their medical team,” Sir Jackie told CNN. “I look forward to see him back in the cockpit.”
    

            Williams driver Valtteri Bottas is also facing an FIA medical Thursday after he was unable to take part in the Melbourne race following a back injury sustained during qualifying.
    

            “After such a frustrating Sunday in Australia, I have taken the necessary measures to make sure I arrive in Malaysia fit to race and ready to bring the results home,” said the in-form Finnish driver.
    

      
      

      

    

            Stewart says it is important that F1 continues to protect its drivers, even if it means insisting they sit out races.
    

            The most serious accident in recent times has left Marussia racer 
 and fighting serious head injuries following a crash in wet conditions at the Japanese Grand Prix last October.
    

            “We shouldn’t take it for granted that drivers are bulletproof,” warned Sir Jackie, who raced in an era of frequent fatalities in the 1960s and 1970s.
    

            “Motor racing is still dangerous. People are surviving accidents but you are this far from death sometimes. 
    

            “You’ve got to recognize that and you cannot be irresponsible. Liberties are being taken today that I prefer are not taken. You can always improve safety.”"
2018-10-22T08:35:37Z,Simon Le Bon: How sailing changed Duran Duran singer’s life,"Duran Duran lead singer Simon Le Bon was at the height of his fame in 1985 when his life was turned upside down.
    

            Le Bon, front man of iconic 1980s British pop band, was competing in the Fastnet yacht race – a 608-mile round trip between the Isle of Wight and Plymouth off Britain’s southwest coast.
    

            He was asleep aboard his 78-foot maxi-yacht Drum when the keel broke off the hull due to a design failure.
    

            The boat capsized, trapping Le Bon and five other crew members inside. Although the alarm was raised straight away by another yacht, Carat, the men were stuck inside the upturned yacht for 40 minutes until they were rescued.
    

            The incident had a profound impact on Le Bon, one of the biggest popstars of the 1980s who just one month before had performed to a worldwide television audience of 1.5 billion as part of Live Aid.
    

            “It really did frighten me,” Le Bon told CNN Sport in an interview at last month’s Southampton Boat Show.
    

            “It’s something you don’t realize until after the event,” said Le Bon, an avid sailor since his youth, with one of the pop group’s early hits – “Rio” – featuring the band members on a yacht in Antigua in the accompanying video.
    

            “About two or three days after it happened, I broke out into this rash, all over my chest, and all over my arms. I am sure it was a stress-related thing. I just couldn’t sleep, because I was asleep when the keel went,” he said, reflecting on the 1985 capsize.
    

            In 2016, Le Bon watched footage of his dramatic rescue, near Falmouth in Cornwall, by the Royal National Lifeboat Institute and a helicopter from the 771 Royal Naval Air Squadron, for the first time as part of a BBC documentary.  
    

            “I had to go down to come up,” he told the BBC. “I dived in and started going up – as I came up the waistband of my long johns got caught and pulled down.”
    

            “As I came up to the surface I stopped about two feet away. I wanted to breathe but if I did I knew that would be the end of me. 
    

            “I managed to get them off my feet and came up with a big smile on my face.
    

            “I got winched off into the helicopter and one of the guys called ‘Hey Simon, where’s your pants?’ because I was just stood there in my knickers.”
    

            Television footage showed the singer back on shore with bare legs. 
    

            “There’s me … a rock star in his underpants,” Le Bon told the BBC.
    

            

    

            

    

            Although Le Bon had entered Drum in the Fastnet as a test event for the 1985-1986 Whitbread Round the World race, he had second thoughts about taking part in the circumnavigation.
    

            A phone call from his experienced American skipper, Skip Novak, three weeks after the capsize changed his mind.
    

            “He said ‘Hey Simon … we’re going to fix her up. And the Whitbread people have agreed to delay the start of the race a whole month so that we can enter,’” Le Bon said in Southampton.
    

            “And I said ‘Skip, I don’t think I can do it. It just terrified me, and I am still suffering.’ And he went: ‘Simon, England expects!’ And I thought, ‘Oh, OK, OK.’” 
    

            

    

            The first few days back on board weren’t easy.
    

            “It was tough, and I remember the first night on the boat that I spent after that, I was rigid,” Le Bon said. “I was like a bow, with my head on the pillow, and my feet on the bed and air between the rest of me and mattress, I was terrified that first night.
    

            “But the second night wasn’t as bad, and the third night was almost OK, and the fourth night, I went to sleep and had a good time, and I woke up in the morning and I thought ‘I’m at sea, and it’s wonderful.’”
    

            Drum would eventually finish third in elapsed time in the Whitbread, which has since changed its name to the Volvo Ocean Race. 
    

            The story of Le Bon’s dramatic rescue created headlines around the world, and more than 10,000 spectator boats welcomed Drum back to British shores. 
    

            When asked if the experience had been life-changing, Le Bon said: “Yes, it was. But we all have life-changing experiences. It was a particularly well-publicized one. That’s the big difference. People trip over a curb and it could be life-changing. These things happen. It’s just part of being human, we all go through these things.”
    

            The capsize also had a big impact on Novak, an expert in polar sailing who would compete in four Whitbread Round the World races.
    

            “There is something singular about having shared a life-threatening experience, the day we found ourselves upside-down in the English Channel,” Novak wrote in a column for Yachting World in 2016. 
    

            “The refit against all the odds strengthened that bond and stood us in good stead for the protracted challenge of the Whitbread race itself, which was no mere outing. It was not the accomplishment that mattered most, but rather the total experience.”  
    

            Le Bon, a father-of-three who turns 60 at the end of October, still performs with Duran Duran. Although he sold Drum in 1988 to Scottish businessman Arnold Clark, he also still sails regularly in regattas and owns a wooden motor boat that’s moored in Italy. 
    

            Le Bon, who recently became a grandfather with his wife, Yasmin, has been a long-serving ambassador of The Blue Marine Foundation (BLUE), which aims to combat the effects of over-fishing and the destruction of biodiversity on the world’s oceans by creating large marine reserves.
    
Pandemonium as Simon Le Bon (Millennials: thats lead singer of Duran Duran), opens 
 

            He is hugely concerned about the future of the world’s oceans.
    

            “As a recreational boater and a swimmer, I want to go down into an undersea park when I put my snorkle and mask on,” he said.
    

            “I want to see fish, I want to see lots of different life, I don’t want to see a dead, gray sea floor, which in the Mediterranean, is really what you’ve got right now. And that’s going to take a lot of work.”"
2015-11-12T08:10:29Z,EU leaders offer nearly $2 billion in aid to Africa to stem migrant crisis,"EU sets up fund of nearly $2 billion aid to Africa to stem the migrant crisis
Sweden to implement temporary border controls 
At least 18 died Wednesday in two boat accidents off Turkey

            As Europe faces its worst refugee crisis since World War II, the European Union has launched an emergency fund for Africa to tackle the spiraling number of migrants flooding its shores.
    

            The nearly $2 billion fund was unveiled at the end of a two-day summit of EU and African leaders in Malta. The fund will support projects to combat poverty, slow down migration and speed up repatriation programs. This new money is in addition to the 20 billion euros annually donated to Africa by the EU and its 28 states.
    

            This is the sixth time that presidents and prime ministers of the European Union have tried to tackle the issue.
    

            “We are under no illusions that we can improve the situation overnight, but we are committed to giving people alternatives to risking their lives,” said European Council President Donald Tusk.
    

            Tusk listed five major goals to stem the tide of migrants: “The elements of action plan are designed to, one, address the root causes of migration; two, enhance cooperation on legal migration and mobility; three, reinforce protection of displaced persons; four, prevent and fight against migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings; and five, advance on returning persons that are not entitled to stay in Europe.” 
    

            Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said that while some may argue that the fund was not enough, he stressed it was an important first step. 
    

            The Mediterranean island nation of Malta is the smallest member of the European Union. About 90 kilometers (56 miles) south of Sicily, it has become one of the destinations for those fleeing Syria’s bloody civil war. 
    

            “I for one am a very vocal critic of the fact that we maybe started acting a little bit too late when too many lives were lost at sea,” Muscat said, adding that he hoped the summit “sowed the seeds of something that can be much more long term.” 
    

            European Council President Tusk also confirmed plans for a summit with Turkey by the end of this year, seen as the key to resolving the crisis. 
    

            After an informal meeting of EU heads after the summit, Tusk said “the clock is ticking. We are under pressure. We need to act fast. As a union. And in cooperation with our partners, including Turkey, that also will have to move fast. 
    

            “But Turkey cannot be our only partner. We must not lose sight of Jordan and Lebanon, nor of the countries of the Western Balkans. They are also our allies.”
    

            Even as Europe tries to forge a unified response to the crisis, tens of thousands continue to embark on perilous journeys, desperate to escape the repression, violence, poverty and insecurity in North Africa, West Africa and the Middle East.
    

            They come from more than 20 nations and with different motivations. 

    

            Many die in their attempt to find a safe haven.
    

            On Wednesday, hours before the EU meeting was scheduled to convene, at least 18 people died off the western coast of Turkey in two boat incidents. 
    

            Mountains of life jackets piled up on the beaches of the Greek island of Lesbos offer a startling testimony to the scale of the problem.
    

            The EU border agency Frontex, which tracks the movement of people, says 540,000 migrants arrived on Greek islands in the first 10 months of 2015. This figure is 13 times higher than in the same period of 2014. 
    

            Syrians account for the largest number of arrivals, according to the Frontex website. In recent weeks, the share of Afghan nationals has risen significantly.
    

            Frontex has called for more than 250 officers to help screen, fingerprint and register migrants.
    

            Meanwhile, Sweden has joined the list of countries that have tightened border controls.
    

            The Ministry of Home Affairs said it will implement temporary border controls for 10 days, and they could be extended to 20 days at some point, according to Fredrik Persson, a spokesman for the ministry.
    

            Sweden’s Prime Minister Stefan Löfven defended the move, telling CNN: “This is not closing the border, the decision we have taken is to reintroduce internal border controls … if a person comes to our country seeking asylum he or she will be given that opportunity.”

2019-10-12T09:26:06Z,The far-right is changing the face of the EU’s third biggest city,"A far-right party is exerting its political influence in the Spanish capital of Madrid, starting with its Christmas lights. 
    

            Vox made a pact with the conservative Partido Popular (PP), which rules the city’s regional government, earlier this year. And the far-right party, a newcomer on Spain’s political scene, has already made its presence felt.
    

            It has seized on cultural issues, and last month secured commitments to increase spending and religious imagery on Christmas decorations around Madrid. Vox has also opposed attempts to improve gender equality and pushed for a new family department to promote what it describes as traditional values.
    

            Each of these policies touches on key issues for Vox, which won four out of 57 seats in May’s Madrid council elections. It then entered negotiations with the PP over policy concessions in exchange for support in crucial council votes. The PP formed the city government in August.
    

            Vox burst onto the political scene in 2018 after taking an unexpectedly high number of seats in the election in Andalusia, Spain’s largest region. Not only did
the result accord the party influence through its crucial support for a PP-led alliance, it also marked something of a watershed – as the first time a far-right party had entered a regional parliament since the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.
    

            It then won 24 out of a total 350 seats in the national parliament in April’s general election, a slightly disappointing result for the party after its Andalusian success, according to some political experts, but one which nonetheless cemented its place as a new political force. 
    

            Vox has attracted voters with its hard line stance on illegal immigration, its opposition to Catalan independence and its calls for Gibraltar to be returned to Spain, as well as an emphasis on cultural traditions, which were raised recently in Madrid.
    

            A Vox spokesman told CNN that the previous regional government had removed all religious symbolism from Christmas decorations in the city, but his party wants to reemphasize the Christian tradition of the festival. “We are not telling people how they should celebrate Christmas but from the institutions we should be accurate and respect the Spanish culture, the Catholic culture,” he said.
    

            This year there will be more lights, larger decorations and new designs that focus on traditional Christmas images. Nativity scenes will be installed at several of the city’s symbolic monumental gates.
    

            Festive decorations are just one symbolic issue that Vox has taken up. The party doesn’t control any council departments and officially remains in opposition. But Vox’s pact with PP means Isabel Díaz Ayuso, Madrid’s regional leader, has promised to develop a program with concessions to Vox. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “I’ll honor it completely because that’s my word,” said Ayuso in reference to the pact, which includes provisions forcing schools to inform parents about the content of lessons before the start of term, and changes to the way in which unaccompanied migrant children are identified.
    

            A Vox spokesman told CNN that there have been mistakes in identifying foreign unaccompanied minors and that there have been cases of people pretending to be children in order to claim certain state benefits.
    

            “We demand that a new way of identification is put in place so we can correctly identify the people who have the right to those benefits,” the spokesman said, emphasizing that Vox has zero tolerance for illegal migration. “We would like those benefits to go to legal and regulated immigration.”
    

            A PP spokeswoman told CNN the identification of minors is the responsibility of the central prosecutor’s office for minors, not regional politicians. The spokeswoman emphasized that any policy changes would have to be made at a national level, rather than by the local Madrid government.
    

            Madrid’s PP mayor, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, will need Vox’s votes again to pass a budget and other essential business. 
    

            However Almeida and Vox spokesman Javier Ortega Smith have already suffered a very public disagreement, arguing in the street in full view of the press and the public on September 19. As Almeida and other public figures observed a minute’s silence in honor of a victim of gender-based violence, Ortega Smith disrupted proceedings holding a sign that read: “Violence has no gender.” 
    

            Speaking about the incident, the Vox spokesman expressed his condolences with the family of the victim. “It was just a way of expressing our condolences from another point of view,” he said. “All victims are the same, they shouldn’t be treated differently because of their gender.” 
    

            Almeida said that he thought Vox had made a mistake in bringing the banner to the memorial. However the mayor also emphasized that he “does not believe in gender ideology” and that the struggle for equality between men and women should be “without ideology.” 
    

      
      

      

    

            Despite the public row, Almeida said that there was nothing “uncomfortable” about the arrangement between Vox and the PP. “I don’t see any issues with the relationship with Vox other than some disagreements that can be solved,” he said at a press conference.
    

            However Yolanda Besteiro, president of feminist organization Fundación de Mujeres Progresistas, told CNN that she is worried and saddened by the PP-Vox pact and Almeida’s statements on gender equality. “It’s dangerous,” she said, warning that the PP is legitimizing the far-right. “It’s a setback in the implementation of gender equality policies.”
    

            With a relationship that includes significant concessions to Vox’ policy program, some had worried that the far-right was controlling the Madrid government. However Maria José Canel, professor of political and public sector communication at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, told CNN that the situation is more nuanced. “It (Vox) holds an important position but not as important as it had hoped,” she said. “Vox is not directly imposing conditions on the local government in Madrid.”
    

            The party secured fewer concessions than it had originally asked for from the PP, according to Canel, and has adopted a less controversial approach in the run-up to new national elections on November 10. “I think they’re going to maintain this softer approach until they work out how many votes they can get,” she said.
    

            However, by staying out of government the party has made a strong strategic move, she added. “It is able to keep its hands free to raise objections and make public declarations against (the government),” said Canel, explaining that it would not have been able to do so if it took control of a council department.
    

            As for Vox’s place in the far-right ecosystem, Canel warns against drawing easy comparisons. “The far-right movement in Spain does not fit the same characteristics as far-right movements in other countries,” she said. 
    

            Canel said that Vox is not as “skillful” as other far-right groups, and pointed out that the vast majority of Spanish voters are in favor of the European Union. Other European far-right movements use opposition to the EU as a rallying cry, something that Vox is unable to do. So the party exists in a specific Spanish context which sets it apart from other far-right groups.
    

            Canel also shut down the idea of deep cooperation between Vox and other far-right figures such as Italy’s interior minister Matteo Salvini of the Northern League party, who has himself been advised by US President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. “It’s not that simple,” she said."
2014-07-21T15:20:24Z,MH17 tributes in Moscow: ‘Forgive us’,"Nearly two-thirds of those who died in the Malaysia Airlines crash in Ukraine were Dutch
In Moscow, people have been leaving flowers and toys outside the Dutch Embassy
Many of the messages include the phrase ""forgive me,"" CNN's Diana Magnay says
One Muscovite told her that Russia's connections with rebels meant it was involved

            Outside the Dutch Embassy in Moscow, people have left flowers and cuddly toys at a makeshift memorial for the lives lost in a conflict-scarred corner of eastern Ukraine.
    

            Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 fell from the sky in Donetsk on Thursday, killing all aboard. Of the 298 people killed, 193 – nearly two-thirds – were Dutch citizens.   
    

            The United States accuses Moscow of supporting the pro-Russian rebels that it suspects shot down the aircraft. 
    

            Russia denies involvement, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying Ukraine’s military operation against the rebels is to blame for the tragedy. He has called for a “thorough and objective” investigation.
    

            With rebels in control of the crash area, and reports of bodies and wreckage being tampered with, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters he had a “very intense” conversation with Putin on Saturday.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Rutte said he told Putin “the opportunity expires to show the world that he is serious about helping.”
    

            The tributes at the Dutch Embassy in Moscow include a hand-drawn picture of a plane broken in midair with the caption “children should not die,” in a child’s handwriting.
    

            Another message reads: “We are afraid, we are ashamed, we are in mourning.”  
    

            While the official Russian position is that Russia played no role and has no responsibility for the crash, what’s striking in many of the notes is the use of the phrase “forgive us.”
    

            The messages give a sense that the people who have left them do feel that Russia has an element of responsibility in what is playing out in eastern Ukraine.
    

            One note reads, in English, “Excuse us, please, if you can. Sorry! Russia, Moscow.”
    

            Paying his condolences at the embassy, Muscovite Yuri Yemshanov told CNN it was “difficult to recognize that our country could be involved in this accident.”
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “I think there’s lot of proof that we’re in closer relations and connections with the separatists in Ukraine. I suppose it’s clearly understood that we support them by providing weapons, and so I think it doesn’t matter who launched that rocket. Just because we’re supporting terrorists, we’re involved.” 
    

            His wife, Marina, added: “I think there should be investigation, but of course many things are understood now and we probably could know who did this. Now I think it’s time to say I’m sorry for these people. This is the  first thing.” 
    

            Another woman, who gave her name as Olga, said that she was sure Russia was not involved in the tragedy and that an investigation would establish who was, but she added: “However, I would also say ‘forgive me.’ I’m feeling the same.”
    

            Arnold van Sinderen, a Dutch citizen living in Moscow, told CNN he believed that the West painted the wrong image of Putin, but that all the same, the Russian leader needed to step up.
    

            “It’s time to take responsibilities there and bring peace in this region. He should take his responsibility as well with what is happening with the plane crash; this might accelerate the situation.”
    

            Meantime, the tributes outside the embassy pile up."
2016-12-23T08:41:32Z,Why Russia’s military adventures worry Europe,"As Russia flexes its military muscles, Baltic states remain on edge
Trump indicated he may break away from US foreign policy traditions during campaign 
Baltics rely heavily on NATO, US protection from Russia

            Janis Garisons isn’t surprised when he hears allegations of Russian hacks targeting the recent US presidential election. 
    

            “Some things you discovered in your pre-election campaign, we’ve been seeing it already for years,” he says.
    

            “They’ve been keeping us awake for twenty-five years,” he tells CNN. “We’re facing Russian propaganda, information warfare and even psychological warfare almost daily.”
    

      
      

      

    

            Garisons is a top official in the defense ministry of Latvia, a small Baltic country that was ruled for nearly a half century by the Kremlin.
    

            When asked for a response, Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for Russian foreign minister told CNN: “Why didn’t Latvia inform Russia about it through the appropriate channels?”

    

            This year, Latvia celebrated a quarter century of regaining independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. But even now, as a part of the European Union as well as a member of the NATO military alliance, the threat from Moscow still lingers. 
    

            Colonel Ilmars Lejins of the Latvian Armed Forces says he considers Latvia’s enormous Russian neighbor his primary threat.
    

            “Our neighbor to the East has shown his intents and capability of disrespecting international law and treaty obligations,” Lejins says. “So I must consider that in my military planning.”
    

            Tensions in eastern Europe have been ratcheting up ever since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the US military presence in the region has increased significantly. 
    

            But the election of Donald Trump has thrown the Baltic States, including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (who rely heavily on US protection), into a great deal of uncertainty.  
    

      
      

      

    

            During the campaign, Trump outlined a sharp break in US foreign policy tradition, suggesting the 
 including the Baltic states, against Russian aggression if they haven’t “fulfilled their obligation to us.”
    

            This rhetoric, combined with his public admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, has left 
that a new Cold War with Putin is coming. 
    

            Publicly, officials in Baltic countries are taking a wait-and-see approach. They stress that they have dramatically increased defense expenditures for the next several years while reminding the US that they have contributed troops to US-led military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
    

            Former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, who famously fought and lost a war against Russia in 2008, predicts the next several months could be particularly tense. 
    

            “Baltic countries are so vulnerable,” Saakashvili told CNN from Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, where he is forming a local political party. 
    

            “We see that the military potential of these three countries (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) cannot match, in any way, the Russian military. And the problem is: I don’t see large European powers coming to their help.”
    

            

    

            In a snowy field in Latvia, cannons lob artillery shells at distant targets. A pair of Blackhawk helicopters land, and soldiers from the US Army’s 173rd Airborne Brigade pour out, firing a rocket attached to a long cord laced with explosives. It detonates, a simulation of how soldiers would blow a path through a deadly minefield in the event of a conflict. 
    

            US troops are performing military maneuvers with the Latvian military and a platoon of soldiers from Slovenia as part of a series of joint exercises called “Atlantic Resolve.”
    

            “The origins were in response to Russian activity in 2014, when the strategic situation changed,” said Colonel Gregory Anderson, who monitored this exercise with his local counterpart Colonel Lejins. 
    

            Anderson was referring to Russia’s lightning-swift occupation and annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea.
    

            To confuse and then push Ukrainian troops out of the region, Russia deployed so-called “little green men,” well-disciplined Russian forces who wore uniforms without insignia or flags identifying their country of origin.
    

            The well-choreographed operation has served as a wake-up call to the new strength and sophistication of the Russian military. 
    

            

    

            If a conflict suddenly exploded with Russia, Latvian commanders say their forces would present little more than a “speed bump” to an advancing Russian military.
    

            “Therefore, the US presence here is very important to deter Russian attempts or simply to avoid miscalculation,” says Garisons, Latvia’s secretary of state.
    

            Latvian officials say, Russia has amassed two armies with an estimated 200,000 troops on the other side of the border. Five years ago, Russia reestablished a helicopter base with scores of aircraft at a location a short drive from the Latvian border. 
    

      
      

      

    

            To protect itself and its population of nearly two million people, Latvia has only 5,000 professional troops as well as a much larger force of volunteer National Guards.
    

            “We need to be a good speed bump that takes out the muffler of the enemy so that it is loud enough that there is no question that this is military aggression against one NATO member,” Colonel Lejins explains. “Then the activation of (Article 5) occurs.”
    

            Under Article 5 of the NATO charter, an attack on one member is considered an attack on all countries in the alliance and requires an active response.
    

            Next, we drive cross country from Latvia, across Lithuania and into Kaliningrad, an exclave of Russian territory sandwiched between Poland and the Baltics, cut off from mainland Russia.
    

            At the end of World War II, Soviet Red Army soldiers wrenched control of this territory from Nazi Germany. For decades, it was a heavily militarized region, closed off to foreigners.
    

            The region lurched into the headlines last fall after Russia confirmed reports it deployed nuclear-capable Iskender missiles to Kaliningrad.
    

             Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov defended Russia’s right to deploy weapons to its sovereign territory in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour last October. 
    

            “They moved NATO infrastructure next to our borders,” Lavrov said. “And this is not United States territory.”
    

            In many ways, Kaliningrad is a historical curiosity. The streets of the main city, which was known in German times as Konigsberg, are lined with grand examples of old German architecture alongside grim, concrete Soviet apartment blocks. 
    

            Here, some Russians also expressed hope about the next US government. 
    

            “With the change of leadership in the US we are hoping for an improvement in the situation,” says Konstantin Smernov, a 53-year-old former lieutenant in the Soviet Navy who now works as a real estate agent. “Confrontation isn’t good for anybody.”  
    

      
      

      

    

            Western governments imposed economic sanctions on Russia after the seizure of Crimea in 2014. In restaurants and in homes here, many Russians said those measures contributed to a broader economic crisis that set in after the plunge in oil prices in recent years.  Oil and natural gas are two of Russia’s most important exports and the backbone of the country’s economy.
    

            Those sanctions, combined with a move last summer to remove visa-free travel for Kaliningrad residents traveling to neighboring Poland, have some here concerned about the former Soviet citadel’s increasing isolation.
    

            

    

            Anna Shugatova was born after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Her dream was to find a job that would allow her to travel. But the 23-year-old, who moved to Kaliningrad from her home in Siberia to pursue a master’s degree in linguistics, says that dream is now in doubt. 
    

            “I don’t know if I will be able to travel soon. There are tensions between countries,” Shugatova said.
    

            But several Russians say they’ve found one advantage to living in an enclave with relatively easy access to countries like Poland and Lithuania. Visitors can purchase and smuggle in foreign foods that are now banned in Russia. 
    

            “We are back to the days of smuggling cheese and sausage from abroad,” said Igor Pleshkov, a businessman and vocal critic of the Kremlin who describes himself as the sole elected member of the opposition on Kaliningrad’s city council.
    

            The Russian port of Baltiysk, about a 45-minute drive towards the coast, is still very much a militarized garrison town. Warships from the Russian Navy’s Baltic Sea Fleet moor at the town entrance, while rows of olive-green military trucks and armored vehicles can be seen in several nearby compounds. 
    

            One of the striking oddities about this region is the dozens of ruined German churches dotting the countryside. These crumbling places of worship stand partially collapsed and empty, symbols of what happened the last time armies fought for control of this part of Europe.

2013-12-21T09:41:00Z,"Pope Francis gives Christmas message of service to Vatican staff, priests","Pope Francis urges the Curia to be professional and to serve the rest of the church
He also warns against gossip, saying it
is harmful to people and the church's work
This is Francis' first Christmas message to the Roman Curia
Since becoming pope, he has been taking steps to reform the way the Holy See is run

            Pope Francis put the ideals of professionalism, service and holiness to the fore Saturday in his first Christmas message to the Curia, the Roman Catholic Church’s governing body.
    

            The Roman Curia, which includes Vatican staff, priests and cardinals, gathered in the ornate Clementine Hall. The pope praised those who have worked in the Vatican for “many years with immense dedication, hidden from the eyes of the world.”
    

            The church needs “people who work with competence, precision and self sacrifice in the fulfillment of their daily duties,” he said.
    

            Without professionalism, Francis warned, “there is a slow drift downwards towards mediocrity” and “dossiers become full of trite and lifeless information” that fail to inspire.
    

      
      

      

    

            Without an attitude of service to bishops and churches worldwide, he said, “the structure of the Curia turns into a ponderous, bureaucratic customs house, constantly inspecting and questioning, hindering the working of the Holy Spirit and the growth of God’s people.”
    

            Holiness encompasses an openness to God, prayer, deep humility and fraternal charity in relationships with fellow workers, Francis said. 
    

            “It also means apostleship, discreet and faithful pastoral service, zealously carried out in direct contact with God’s people. For priests, this is indispensable,” he said.
    

            He also urged the Curia to avoid indulging in gossip, saying: “Gossip is harmful to people, our work and our surroundings.”
    

            Francis has already taken a number of steps to try to reform the Vatican’s administration in the nine months since he was elected to the papacy.
    

            CNN’s Vatican reporter John Allen, also a senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, said Saturday’s speech was brief but set out some core principles.
    

            “He said very clearly he wants a Vatican that is focused on service, rather than power,” Allen said.
    

            In July, the pope set up an expert committee to recommend reforms to the economic and administrative structures of the Holy See. He has also ordered more scrutiny of the Vatican bank, which has been plagued by financial scandals for years.
    

            Earlier this month, he announced the creation of a commission to prevent the abuse of minors and to support victims of abuse.
    

            The Catholic Church has faced calls for reform in the wake of scandals involving the sexual abuse of children by priests and allegations of corruption.
    

            Since taking charge, Francis has also shifted the tone of the church toward a focus on service, compassion and helping the poor and addressed controversial issues such as homosexuality and the role of women in the church.
    

            At his final general audience of 2013 in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday, the pope spoke about the birth of Jesus and the importance of humility.
    

            “It is an ugly thing,” he said, “when you see a Christian who doesn’t want to humble himself, who doesn’t want to serve, a Christian who struts about everywhere: it’s ugly, eh? That is not a Christian: that’s a pagan!”
    

            In a measure of the impact he’s already had as pontiff, Francis was named as Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” this month.
    

            The Vatican welcomed Time’s selection, while making it clear the man so widely recognized for his own humility didn’t seek the award and didn’t want its light to shine on him but on the mission of the church."
2021-01-20T16:24:17Z,Australian Open tennis stars urged not to feed mice in hotel rooms,"“Wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim’rous beastie,”

            It’s a sentiment perhaps shared by some 
 stars, who locked in their hotel rooms for two weeks with no human interaction ahead of the 
, appear to be having a fair bit of contact with said tim’rous beasties.
    

            Notably world No. 28 Yulia Putintseva, who was forced to swap rooms in her quarantine hotel in Melbourne after she discovered a mouse, only to find out that her new room was also infested.
    

            In a video she posted on Twitter, the Kazakhstan player said: “Different room same story. Wanted to go to sleep but noooope!”
    

            

    
it’s actually a lot of them! Not even 1 in my room now🤦🏼‍♀️ 

            The 26-year-old followed up with another video saying: “It’s actually a lot of them! Not even 1 in my room now.”
    

            As a strategy to deal with any mice in hotel rooms, Victoria’s emergency services minister Lisa Neville recommended not feeding them.
    

            “As I understand there may have been some feeding going on,” Neville 
 CNN affiliate 9news.
    

            “Firstly, we moved the particular tennis player the other day. We’ve had the hotel pest control this week and I think there may have been some feeding going on with the mice.”
    

            Putintseva is one of the 72 players and their teams that have been forced to quarantine in their hotel rooms for 14 days after their arrival in Australia ahead of 2021’s first grand slam.
    

            

    

            Without the ability to go out and train ahead of the tournament, players have voiced their frustrations, including record eight-time Australian Open men’s singles winner Novak Djokovic, who put forward a list of proposals that would loosen the restrictions on the quarantining stars, including moving players to houses with courts, better food, and reducing the number of days in isolation.
    

            Putintseva herself was one of the first players to complain about the treatment of the players, raising concerns about the lack of fresh air and the fact windows can’t be opened."
2018-12-11T09:51:34Z,(It’s not just you) Brexit is making Britain very hard to understand right now,"The UK must look very weird to the outside world at the moment. 
    

            Don’t worry though: Brexit, 
, has left much of the UK’s population just as confused. 
    

            This week, it looked as though Prime Minister Theresa May’s hard-won yet widely-loathed Brexit deal with the European Union would finally have its moment in the spotlight, as lawmakers were set to vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday. Then, after a weekend of speculation, 

    

            48 hours later, she 
. The result of this vote – win or lose – could fundamentally alter the Brexit timetable and change the entire complexion of UK politics.  
    

      
      

      

    

            One of the most common questions that European politicos are asked by people with better things to do is “what will actually happen with Brexit?” For the last couple of years, it’s been possible to conjure up half answers that sound a bit clever and move on. But the awful truth, even this late in the game, is that no one knows – even the people in charge. 
    

            This partly stems from the current reality of British politics. No one, it seems, has a workable plan that can be credibly presented as something that might, you know, feasibly happen. 
    

            May and her inner circle have failed to convince the UK’s Parliament that her deal really is the best – and only – thing on the table.
    

            As a result, the Prime Minister pulled the so-called meaningful vote on her Brexit deal, presumably for fear of a heavy defeat and the chain of events that could follow.
    

            Should she survive the confidence vote, May will then head back to Brussels in the hope that she get secure sufficient assurances on her deal and sway MPs to vote for it. 
    

            Never let it be said that the Prime Minister is not an optimist…
    

            One of the many problems she faces is that even her own Conservative Party hates the deal, in large part because of something called the Irish border backstop. 
    

            The border between the Republic of Ireland (an EU member state) and Northern Ireland (part of the UK) has been the thorniest issue of the whole Brexit process. For historical reasons, both negotiating teams have from day one said that avoiding a hard border was an absolute priority. 
    

            Unfortunately, for boring reasons to do with trade and customs, that is likely impossible unless Northern Ireland is in some kind of Customs Union with the EU, which means the whole UK if you don’t want to break up the Union.
    

            Conservatives loathe this, as they have long hailed the ability to independently trade with countries around the world as the prize for Brexit (see why that is a fantasy 
). 
    

            Then there’s the opposition Labour Party and its fudgy Brexit policy. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn seemed to as good as admit on Monday that he accepted the negotiations were closed and that the EU would not budge on the border. He also implied that May should stand aside and allow a leader (presumably one J. Corbyn) capable of negotiating a better deal to take over. It doesn’t take a genius to work out the problem here.  
    

            Labour’s other problem is that it is almost as divided as the Conservative Party on Brexit – especially on the matter of a second referendum, or the People’s Vote, as it’s known. Corbyn and his top team seem reluctant to endorse this outright. They certainly don’t want to be seen as supporting any efforts to prevent Brexit – something many in Westminster believe to be the ultimate intention of the People’s Vote.  
    

            The People’s Vote is backed by people across the political spectrum. And its supporters have extra pep in their step after the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK could hypothetically revoke Article 50, should it want to and with a mountain of caveats.
    

      
      

      

    

            But with only 15 weeks to go until Brexit, it’s not exactly clear how such a vote could even be carried out, which of the two main parties would back what side, how it would be funded, what the question would be, how many answers there would be and what government would legislate for it. 
    

            Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, the EU has said repeatedly that negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement are not going to be reopened; it is likely not possible to have a second referendum before Brexit Day (ergo, the UK would very much not unilaterally have to ask the EU to extend Article 50); there is no guarantee that the Norway option is something the EU even wants (why would it want the second largest EEA economy unbeholden to EU law?); and, whisper it, but both frontbenches support Brexit and would likely have to were there a second referendum. 
    

            So how’s that for clarity? For some unknown reason, politicians of all factions and levels of seniority have had their ill-considered whims indulged for over two years now. Rather than be forcibly whipped in line and made to confront reality, the UK’s all-consuming political vacuum has created a safe space for a sort of fantasy land.
    

            Meanwhile, with only 15 weeks to go until Brexit day, the world still has no clarity on what’s about to become of its fifth largest economy. 
    

            It might be funny if it wasn’t so terrifying."

2013-10-10T04:36:29Z,"NSA leaker Edward Snowden deserves a Nobel Prize, his father says","NEW: Edward Snowden has job offers in Russia and has a girlfriend there, lawyer says
Snowden's father says he wants to get on with his life but stresses that he loves his son
Snowden fled the U.S. after leaking information about NSA spy programs 
He received asylum in Russia after being holed up at a Moscow airport for weeks

            The father of NSA leaker 
 told reporters in Moscow that he thinks his son deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.
    

            He arrived there Thursday for his first visit with his son since the former government IT contractor fled the United States after leaking National Security Agency spy program details to the media.
    

            Members of the European Parliament nominated Snowden  in September  for the Andrei Sakharov Prize, which honors figures who stand up to oppressive powers.  The prize was awarded to Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai on Thursday.
    

            “Edward took the Sakharov prize nomination very calmly,” Lon Snowden told reporters at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport. “He wanted to expose the injustices in the American system, and wasn’t doing it with any awards in mind.”
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Edward Snowden collected information on spy programs, in which the NSA mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States. He exposed the program to the media.
    

            Anticipating legal consequences, he initially fled to Hong Kong in late May but flew to Moscow on June 23. He was holed up at the airport for more than five weeks. U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property.
    

            Snowden received asylum in Russia on August 1 and left the airport.
    

            

    

            

    

            Lon Snowden’s visit to Russia seems shrouded in mystery, as Edward Snowden is keeping information about himself close to the vest.
    

            “I’ve had no direct contact with my son despite previous reports, so I really have no idea what his intentions are,” Lon Snowden told reporters at the airport.
    

            
 has kept a low profile, apparently not even telling his father where in Russia he is living. 
    

            “I cannot answer the question if Edward is in Moscow,” Lon Snowden said. “I don’t know that. I haven’t been informed where Edward is right now.”
    

            His lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, also has not disclosed Snowden’s location. But he told reporters that he had met with him Wednesday.  
    

            It appears that Snowden is settling in to his new surroundings.
    

            He has been living from savings and donations but has had some job offers, Kucherena said.
    

            “I am confident that he would find a high-paying job. He is very capable.”  He is also learning Russian and soaking in Russian culture, Kucherena said.
    

            And he has a girlfriend.
    

            The lawyer earlier told reporters that Edward Snowden may hold a news conference soon, but later reversed that, saying the former contractor had no intention of speaking publicly.
    

            Since the movie “The Fifth Estate” came out, which is based on the experiences of WikiLeaker Julian Assange, producers have contacted Snowden about telling his story on film. 
    

            But he does not seem interested at the time.
    

            

    

            As in the past, Lon Snowden defended his son’s actions Thursday, calling him a “whistle-blower” who is “not leaking information.”  
    

            “I don’t think the American public knows all the details of what my son did,” he said.
    

            Snowden has said that he does not expect his son to receive a fair trial in the United States and would not want him to come home, until that changes. 
    

            “I’m not sure that my son will be returning to the U.S. again. That’s his decision. He is an adult,” the elder Snowden told reporters.
    

            He thanked the Russian people and President Vladimir Putin for taking his son in. “I consider Edward to be absolutely safe in Russia. He is comfortable here,” he said.
    

            Lon Snowden has received a visa for multiple entries into the country.  “I hope to return to Russia many times,” he said.
    

            Father Lon carefully separated his own interests from Edward Snowden’s, speaking of getting on with his own life in the United States, while his son moves on with his in Russia.
    

            But he in no way distanced himself from the younger Snowden.
    

            He told reporters: “I am his father. I love my son.”

2018-01-15T08:26:44Z,Venus Williams exits on rough day for Americans,"Venus Williams loses to Belinda Bencic 
Williams made last year's final 
Tough day for Americans in Melbourne 
Rafael Nadal crushes Victor Estrella Burgos

            Comebacks were the order of the day at the Australian Open. 
    

            Typically understated in victory, Williams on that occasion dropped her racket, pirouetted and skipped to the net. A double pirouette soon followed and you couldn’t wipe the smile off her face. It set the tone for a fine 2017 season, even if the evergreen Williams lost to younger sister Serena in the final. 
    

            

    

            

    

            But handed with a tough draw at this year’s Australian Open, the seven-time grand slam champion couldn’t replicate last year’s success at Melbourne Park and was upset by a resurgent Belinda Bencic 6-3 7-5 on what was a difficult day for Americans on the first day of the year’s first major. 
    

            “This is, like, a new year,” Williams, who was seeking to become the oldest grand slam winner in tennis history, told reporters. “You can’t live in the previous year. It’s impossible.
    

            “I don’t think I played a bad match. She just played above and beyond. I just have to give her credit for that.”
    

            With Serena skipping the event because the record 23-time grand slam winner isn’t ready to return to tournament play four months after giving birth to a first child, it means no Williams sister is in the second round of a major for the first time since 1997. 
    
❌ Venus Williams OUT 
❌ Jack Sock OUT 
❌ Sloane Stephens OUT
❌ CoCo Vandeweghe OUT
❌ John Isner OUT

            Joining the 37-year-old Venus in making early exits were Sloane Stephens – who hasn’t won a match since surprisingly 
in September – and Vandeweghe. All three made the semifinals in New York. 
    

            The fourth American semifinalist at Flushing Meadows, Madison Keys, is still in contention – she won’t contest her opener against China’s Wang Qiang until Tuesday. 
    

            And men’s eighth seed Jack Sock, a semifinalist at the year-end Tour Finals in London in November, tumbled at the hands of Japan’s Yuichi Sugita 6-1 7-6 (7-4) 5-7 6-3. 
    

            Of the 15 Americans on the schedule Monday, only three – Ryan Harrison, qualifier Mackenzie McDonald and Nicole Gibbs – prevailed.
    

            Another player who enjoyed success in New York was also eliminated, men’s finalist Kevin Anderson. The Florida-based South African fell to Kyle Edmund – the lone British man in the draw in the 
 – 6-7 (4-7) 6-3 3-6 6-3 6-4. 
    
When you wake up day one of the 
 and remember you aren’t in the draw 😢 

            Bencic encountered a Williams sister in the first round for a second consecutive Australian Open – she lost to Serena 12 months ago – but this time around the former prodigy was in much better form. 
    

            Having climbed to seventh in the rankings in 2016, back and wrist injuries heavily contributed to the Swiss dropping to 317th last season. 
    

            Bencic, however, finished 2017 by going 28-3 at all levels and combined with Roger Federer to help Switzerland win this month’s Hopman Cup. Federer’s parents were in the 20-year-old’s player box at Rod Laver Arena. 
    

            The Swiss took the final four games of the first set, then rallied from a break down in the second to register a first win over Williams in five attempts.

            “It was amazing, this match,” Bencic told reporters. 
    

            “I think the level was great. Also she beat me four times before, so I was really happy, took my chance this time.
    

            “Obviously just happy to be back playing. It was a very, very long time when I was out. I couldn’t wait to come back, so it means a lot.”
    

            

    

            

    

            Given Bencic’s form, don’t discount a long stay in Melbourne. With Serena out of action – just as she was for the final three majors of 2017 – the women’s draw is fairly wide open as Vandeweghe’s conqueror, Timea Babos, acknowledged. 
    

            “In women’s tennis, I think we see it – anything can happen when there is no Serena Williams,” said the Hungarian, who triumphed 7-6 (7-4) 6-2. 
    

            Vandeweghe received a code violation from chair umpire Fergus Murphy, as she wasn’t ready to take to the court because she was eating a banana. Vandeweghe said she had to wait for the bananas – a good source of potassium – to be brought courtside, hence the delay. 
    

            Stephens was ruled out of this month’s Brisbane International with a knee injury and lost in straight sets to Camila Giorgi in the first round in Sydney, hardly the best preparation for Melbourne. 
    

            Not serving out the match at 5-4 in the second set Monday was the obvious turning point and the 13th seed went out to China’s Zhang Shuai – somewhat of a fan favorite at the Australian Open – 2-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 to suffer an eighth straight defeat. 
    

            “I did everything that I could to be ready for Sydney last week and for here,” Stephens told reporters. “It’s just unfortunate, but it’s definitely only the beginning of the season, first two tournaments. Not going to get too down.”
    

            Zhang was close to quitting tennis following an 0-for-14 skid at grand slams. Her fortunes changed, though, when she upset Simona Halep in the first round in Melbourne two years ago and last week she narrowly missed out on a seeding for Melbourne, coming in ranked 34th. 
    

            Rafael Nadal progressed to the second round in 94 minutes, downing 37-year-old Victor Estrella Burgos 6-1 6-1 6-1. It was a flawless start from  the world No. 1, who is playing the Australian Open for the first time without competing at a warmup tournament. Blame his knees. 
    

            

    

            Nadal drew as much attention for his attire, going back to a sleeveless look for the first time in nearly a decade. 
    

            The man Nadal lost to in last year’s gripping men’s finale, Federer, begins his quest for a 20th major Tuesday against Slovenia’s Aljaz Bedene. 
    

            Six-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, plays his first official match since Wimbledon against Donald Young. 
    

            If Young topples Djokovic, it would no doubt bring some joy to American tennis in Melbourne following Monday’s dreadful start."

            In a widely shared Twitter post, Liverpool and Egypt star Mo Salah urged world leaders, specifically British Minister Boris Johnson, “to do everything in their power to make sure the violence and killing of innocent people stops immediately.”
    
I’m calling on all the world leaders including on the Prime Minister of the country that has been my home for the past 4 years to do everything in their power to make sure the violence and killing of innocent people stops immediately. Enough is enough.  

            But the post generated as much comment for what it didn’t say, as for what it did.
    

            “Mo Salah, say it with me, Pal-es-tine,” tweeted law professor Khaled Beydoun of the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville School of Law in reply to Salah.
    

            Author Samar Jarrah tweeted: “Hope next tweet you will mention Palestinians.”
    

            In an earlier tweet, Salah posted a photo of himself standing in front of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.
    
Hope next tweet you will mention Palestinians.

            Dozens of people, including women and children, have been killed and hundreds more injured in Israeli bombing raids across Gaza this week, according to Palestinian health officials. While militants in Gaza have fired more than 1,000 rockets into Israel in recent days, killing at least five Israeli citizens and injuring 200 more, the Israeli military said.
    

            Salah isn’t the only high-profile Premier League footballer tweeting about the escalating violence between Palestinians and Israel, notably Manchester City stars Benjamin Mendy and Riyad Mahrez have both tweeted to show their solidarity with the Palestinians.
    
🤲🏼🇵🇸 
 
 

            Inter Milan star Achraf Hakimi and Porto’s Moussa Marega also tweeted their support of Palestinians.
    

            Last weekend, players of Chilean first division club Palestino – founded in 1920 by Palestinian immigrants – wore the keffiyeh, a chequered black and white traditional Arab scarf, before their match against Colo-Colo to show their support for Palestinians.

            “It is a situation that I would never wish on anyone and we understand that we represent a people who have suffered since 1948,” Palestino club captain Luis Jimenez 
. “We cannot remain silent in the face of what is happening today in Sheikh Jarrah, where Palestinians are being evicted from their homes in Jerusalem.”
    

            On Wednesday, British PM Johnson tweeted: “I am urging Israel and the Palestinians to step back from the brink and for both sides to show restraint. The UK is deeply concerned by the growing violence and civilian casualties and we want to see an urgent de-escalation of tensions.”"

, which has infected almost 180,000 people worldwide.
    

            Videos show people swarming grocery stores and fighting over essentials such as toilet paper. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Morrison bluntly told Australians to “stop hoarding” essential foodstuffs. 
    

            “Stop it. It’s not sensible, it’s not helpful and I’ve got to say, it’s been one of the most disappointing things I’ve seen in Australian behavior in response to this crisis. That is not who we are as a people,” he said.
    

            Morrison, who has faced criticism from some doctors for not imposing stricter social isolation measures, also announced extended restrictions on mass gatherings to all indoor events with more than 100 people, however, he insisted that schools would remain open to ensure hospitals were properly staffed.
    

            “This is a once-in-100 year type event, we haven’t seen this sort of thing in Australia since the end of the first World War, but together we are of course up to this challenge,” he said.
    

            Morrison warned the disruptions could continue for “at least six months … it could be much longer.” 
    

            As of Wednesday there were more than 450 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Australia, according to local health authorities. That’s up from just over 100, a little more than one week previous.

            Some fear the rapid rise in coronavirus cases suggest that Australia’s normally robust health system could be overwhelmed, like Italy’s where more than 2,000 people have died, according to the WHO.
    

            Australia’s response to the outbreak is being led by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), which has stressed the need for social distancing to slow the spread of the disease.
    

            “We are in a situation now where there are mainly imported cases, small numbers, there is no need for to be in a state of heightened anxiety but we do need to be prepared,” said Brendan Murphy, Australia’s Chief Medical Officer, who chairs the AHPPC.
    
""Stop hoarding. I can't be more blunt about it. Stop it. It is not sensible, it is not helpful"" - Prime Minister 
 on panic buying in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 
 
 
 
 

            But shoppers have largely ignored calls for calm. CNN affiliate Seven News reported that police had to be called into 
 Wednesday to help organize masses of shoppers who were panic buying.
    

            Some large supermarkets in major cities such as Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Sydney have sold out of fruit, vegetables, meat and dry goods, such as a rice, as Australians buy up essentials amid fears of a lengthy epidemic.
    

            Melbourne father Matthew Weijers told CNN he hadn’t even been able to find diapers for his daughter Adelyn given the widespread panic buying.
    

            “It’s crazy, everyone came together over the bushfires and now they’re fighting for supplies in the lines at supermarkets,” he said.
    
Virus fears are still choking supermarkets with shelves remaining bare in many suburbs across the country. The fight for toilet paper was escalated in a Sydney Woolworths as fists were being thrown, before staff intervened. 
 
 
 

            On Wednesday, leading supermarket chain Woolworths banned shoppers from buying more than two of any single type of packaged goods. Toilet roll restrictions were already in place at major supermarkets, preventing customers from buying more than one pack each.
    

            Australia exports most of the food it produces and recent rain has ensured that crops aren’t in short supply.
    

            “We’re certainly not running out of food,” National Farmers’ Federation chief executive Tony Mahar told the ABC. “There’s lots to go around.”
    

            Australia’s travel alert level has been raised to Level 4, as of Wednesday, which calls on all citizens to avoid any international travel. Anyone who arrives in the country from overseas will now be required to self-quarantine for 14 days.
    

            Australians abroad have been urged to travel home as soon as possible on commercial flights, as consular help maybe not be available should more countries decide to close their borders.
    

            Major sporting and private events
have been canceled and the government has taken the unprecedented step of canceling Australia’s Anzac Day commemorations on April 25, a major annual ceremony and march honoring citizens who died while serving in the military during major conflicts.
    

            But unlike other countries facing a coronavirus epidemic, public outdoor gatherings of up to 500 people are still allowed and schools remain open. 
    

            Parents and teachers’ unions have questioned the move to continue classes, with NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos saying in a statement that many schools could easily classify as 

    

            “The lack of clarity, consistency and, at times, conflicting advice and opinions expressed by the medical community and elected leaders is creating considerable stress for teachers and principals,” he said in a statement Tuesday.

 in Pyeongchang, but it’s the whipping wind that has hampered races in recent days and raised concerns over competitors’ safety. 
    

            Temperatures in South Korea are registering around -11˚C (12˚F). 
    

            When combined with wind chill, however, the mercury plummets dramatically to -26˚C (-14˚F) degrees. 
    

            While it’s not uncommon for Alpine sports to face high winds and excessive snow, the extreme conditions in Pyeongchang have made staging events increasingly challenging.
    

            Officials have called-off several competitions including the women’s giant slalom which was due to take place Monday at the Yongpyong Alpine Center. 
    

            The weather could become “a real problem for the organizers because this is forecast to last for at least the next four days,” CNN’s Christina Macfarlane reported from the Games. 
    

            The women’s giant slalom has been rescheduled for Thursday, according to the US Ski and Snowboard Team – the same day as the postponed men’s downhill race, which was delayed on Sunday.
    

            Olympic downhill is traditionally one of the Games’ biggest draws and this year’s competition is likely the last chance for Olympic veterans like Aksel Lund Svindal and Lindsey Vonn to win gold. 
    

            Ninety-eight-percent of the snow on the course is artificial as the weather is too cold for the snow to fall. But some athletes will prefer “fake snow” on the course as it keeps the conditions more consistent.
    
It's pretty windy in Pyeongchang. Just ask 
.
 
 

            One race that did proceed on Monday was the final of the ladies’ snowboard slopestyle. Bone-chilling gusts of wind tore through the mountains as American snowboarder Jamie Anderson managed to successfully retain the title, while Laurie Blouin from Canada won silver and Finland’s Enni Rukajarvi took home bronze. 
    

            Even after a delayed start, windy conditions at Phoenix Snow Park had a noticeable and sometime farcical effect on many of the competitors, with most failing to complete a single clean run after being blown off course by intense crosswinds.
    
At the snowboard slopestyle, where six of the first seven have crashed, and one didn't even attempt a jump. Strong winds playing havoc.

            
 
    

            Sung Baik-you, spokesman for the local organizing committee said Monday that the winds had been very strong, making the competition difficult but that the safety of the athletes was their top priority leading to some events being rescheduled. 
    

            The International Ski Federation also issued a statement on Monday in response to athletes, coaches and fans who complained about the strong winds which made conditions “dangerous” and made it tough for some athletes to perform at their best. 
    

            FIS said it “would never stage a competition” if the safety of athletes could not be assured. 
    

            The organization added the weather was deemed stable enough for the competition to continue after a 30-minute delay where officials monitored conditions and a 45-minute training session without problems. 
    

            However, some competitors have come to the IOC’s defense, praising organizers for their handling of the events. 
    

            After qualification for the snowboard ladies’ halfpipe final at the Phoenix Snow Park on Monday, American Chloe Kim described the conditions as “amazing” while Emily Arthur from Australia called the atmosphere “insane.”
    

            “This is the best pipe I’ve ever ridden,” Arthur said.  
    

            On Sunday, Australian snowboarder Tess Coady lamented the conditions many are facing after suffering a serious injury during a practice session. 
    

            “Well Olympics came to a screeching holt today for me… got picked up in the wind on the bottom jump in practice and my acl was not a big fan! Thanks for all the lovin everyone…brb,” she

            “An investigation is underway to understand the full circumstances and I continue to stay in close contact with the Met and other emergency services,” Khan said.
    

            Police were called at 9:54 a.m. local time to reports that a car collided with a building at the primary school in Camp Road, the force said in a statement. The institution is a fee-paying girls’ school for pupils aged 4-11.
    

            The school said it was “profoundly shocked by the tragic accident” that took place and was “devastated that it has claimed the life of one of our young pupils as well as injuring several others.” 
    

            “Now that a police investigation is underway we will not be making any further public statement for the time being and would ask that the privacy of our school community is respected at this deeply upsetting time,” The Study Preparatory School
