            Liverpool teammates 
and Sadio Mane will come face to face in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) final after Egypt booked its place in Sunday’s game. 
    

            
 was awaiting the winner of Thursday’s semifinal between Cameroon and Egypt and, despite the host having the better chances, it was the Pharaohs who progressed on penalties. 
    

            Egyptian goalkeeper Mohamed Abou Gabal produced two brilliant saves in the shootout before Cameroon’s Clinton Njie fired his penalty wide of the post to send Egypt through after a goalless draw. 
    

            Egypt will now be bidding for a record-extending eighth AFCON title while Senegal looks to win its first. 
    

            Sunday’s final will also be the first of three matches between the two sides in the coming months with the teams pitted against each other in a two-legged playoff for a place in this year’s World Cup in Qatar. 
    

            Both Salah and Mane have spearheaded Liverpool’s success in recent seasons and they now carry the hopes of their nations on their backs. 
    

            Neither have been in lightning form during this year’s tournament but both have still scored goals, Mane netting three times and Salah twice. 
    

            

    

            Senegal last reached an AFCON final in 2019, eventually losing 1-0 to Algeria, and the current crop of players will certainly be feeling the weight of expectation to finally end the country’s wait for a title. 
    

            The current team – the top-ranked side on the continent – is full of talented players, representing clubs such as Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Liverpool and Bayern Munich.
    

            “Experience is a good asset,” Mane said. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “I think that has always been the case since the start of this tournament. We suffered so much with a lot of Covid cases and several injuries too.
    

            “We had a very difficult time, but with our experience, we kept calm until we recovered the whole group.
    

            “We played a final last time, so we have experience and we will try to win this trophy.”
    

            Egypt, meanwhile, have surprised many by making it so far in the tournament and have scraped through games without producing much exciting football. 
    

            Perhaps crucially, Egypt will be without manager Carlos Queiroz on the sideline for the final after the former Manchester United assistant was sent off for arguing with the referee in Thursday’s match. 
    

            Queiroz has been pivotal in making this Egyptian side hard to beat but will now watch from behind the scenes as the country looks to make yet more history. 
    

            It will once again look to rely on Salah who has been one of the best players in the world this season. 
    

            “We are happy, it’s true, but we have not yet reached the final objective,” Egypt’s assistant coach, Diaa Elsayed, said after the match. 
    

            “I can also add that our background is also due to the presence of one of the great players, namely Mohamed Salah. A very essential player in our team and who remains the centerpiece for us.”
    

            Salah posted videos to his Instagram story of the Egyptian players celebrating their semifinal victory on the team bus, but he will be looking to go one further to establish himself further as a serial winner.

Taxi drivers' association argues that Uber is unfair competition and lacks proper licenses
It is expected to file a formal complaint before the court; Uber can then make its case

            A Spanish judge on Tuesday temporarily banned cell phone-based taxi service Uber from operating in Spain after a complaint brought by taxi drivers in the capital, Madrid.
    

            The judge issued the ban, the equivalent of a temporary injunction, on the grounds that Uber was deemed to be causing damage to the taxi industry, a court spokesman said.
    

            The hearing was in response to a complaint by the Madrid taxi association, which argued that Uber is unfair competition and also lacks the proper municipal licenses to operate a taxi service.
    

            The Madrid taxi association is expected now to file a formal lawsuit with the court, after gathering more documents and information, the court spokesman said.
    

            Legal arguments for Uber were not heard before the judge because the company is located outside of Spain, in the U.S. state of Delaware, and the taxi industry was seeking immediate relief, he said.
    

            The company is expected to have a chance to argue its points before the judge when the formal lawsuit is filed.
    

            The Madrid ruling comes on the same day that 
 after an Uber driver was accused of raping a woman in New Delhi.
    

            Transport authorities in New Delhi on Monday

            Adored by millions of fans around the world, 
 suddenly find themselves in an unusual position – a lightning rod for criticism from both the public and politicians amid the coronavirus pandemic.
    

            Earlier this week, Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United, Norwich City and Bournemouth announced they would be using 
–  intended to aid those employers most severely affected by the Covid-19 shutdown – to help pay the wages of non-playing members of staff placed on temporary leave.
    

            However, with the 20 Premier League clubs sharing the spoils of the current multi-billion dollar TV rights deal, many questioned why the players – who earn on average £3 million ($3.7 million) per year – weren’t helping foot the bill.
    

            “I think everybody needs to play their part in this national effort and that means Premier League footballers too,” British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said during Thursday’s daily coronavirus briefing.
    

            “Given the sacrifices people are making, including some of my colleagues in the NHS, who have made the ultimate sacrifice and gone into work and caught the disease and have sadly died, I think the first thing Premier League footballers can do is make a contribution; take a pay cut and play their part.”
    

            

    

            The Professional Footballers Association (PFA) – the players’ union in England – has been holding talks with the Premier League and the English Football League (EFL) over soccer’s response to Covid-19 and one former leading player Gary Lineker, who now works as a TV pundit, told CNN that the football stars were convenient scapegoats for politicians.
    

            “We do tend to have a go at footballers quite easily,” former England international Gary Lineker told Richard Quest. “They’re easy game. Yes, they get paid a lot of money, but I’m sure they want to help. 
    

            “They’re consistently very good in the communities and I’m sure over the coming days that footballers will stand up and be counted, either taking pay cuts or making donations to charities or staff workers that are non-playing. 
    

            “So, I’m confident that will happen, but it takes time and everyone here is jumping on the bandwagon. Politicians do tend to do that occasionally, especially at football’s expense – so, if I’m wrong, then I’ll be as critical as everybody else.”
    

            In a statement released on Friday, the Premier League said it planned to start a consultation exercise with top-flight players.
    

            “In the face of substantial and continuing losses for the 2019/20 season since the suspension of matches began, and to protect employment throughout the professional game, Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to consult their players regarding a combination of conditional reductions and deferrals amounting to 30% of total annual remuneration.
    

            “The League will be in regular contact with the PFA, and the union will join a meeting which will be held tomorrow [April 4] between the League, players and club representatives.”
    

            

    

            This week, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid players took a 70% wage cut to ensure that all non-playing members of staff continue to get paid a full salary during the pandemic, while Juventus’ first-team squad has given up 100% of its wages for four months to save the club $100 million.
    

            “I think one or two of our clubs have kind of thrown their players under a PR bus in many ways by announcing that they’re cutting staff salaries and putting them on furlough, but not affecting the players’ wages,” said Lineker.
    

            “That was not announced by the players, but it was announced by the clubs, so let’s wait and see. Let’s be a little bit patient here. Let’s not all jump on the judgment high horse and just wait and see how it pans out over the next week or so. 
    

            “I’m confident and I would be very disappointed if the players don’t do the right thing, but I’m sure they will.”
    

            

    

            The PFA called an urgent meeting on March 27 with the Premier League and the EFL to ensure the salaries of footballers in the third and fourth tiers – whose wages, it says, are “closer to the national average” – were protected for April.
    

            “Many of these players will have contracts ending in June,” the PFA said in a statement on Thursday. “These are often people with young families, for whom their immediate financial position is uncertain.”
    

            While TV money has funded handsome salaries for many players, it’s arguably also benefited the super-rich owners of the 20 Premier League clubs, whose combined wealth totals close to $85 billion, according to Forbes.
    

            Which is why the the PFA says that while it is aware of the public’s belief that players should give up their salaries to pay the wages of non-playing members of staff, it reiterated its stance that if clubs can afford to pay both, then they should continue to do so.
    

            “The players we have spoken to recognize that the non-playing staff are a vital part of their club and they do not want to see club staff furloughed unfairly,” it said. “Any use of the government’s support schemes without genuine financial need is detrimental to the wider society. 
    

            “In instances where clubs have the resources to pay all staff, the benefit of players paying non-playing staff salaries will only serve the business of the club’s shareholders.”

Ajax set record in 1971-72 season 
The New Saints can break it on Dec 30

            Chelsea may be grabbing all the headlines with its impressive 12-match winning streak in the English Premier League, but that’s nothing compared to a team across the border in Wales.
    

            The New Saints FC notched a 26th consecutive win in the Welsh Premier League on Monday to equal the world record by set Dutch giant Ajax during 1971-72 Eredivisie season. 
    

            The four-time European champion tweeted its congratulations to the Welsh side, which cruised to a 4-0 victory over Cefn Druids in front of a home crowd. 
    
great achievement guys! Happy Boxing Day! 👊

            “It’s been a bit of a shock that we’ve got to this stage,” club chairman Mike Harris told CNN’s World Sport show Tuesday.  
    

            “We’d recognized that we’d got to the longest run of games in our league a few weeks ago when we passed the Bangor City total, but we still thought we had a bit of a way to go.”
    

            Harris and the club were only made aware of the feat when the Guinness Book of Records got in touch before the crucial match on Boxing Day.   
    

            

    

            “That got everyone a little bit on edge, but obviously the game went in our favor so we managed to get over that last hurdle,” Harris said. 
    

            “I think the players are a great set of players and you’ve also got to give great testimony to our manager Craig Harrison, who is very professional in the way that he treats every single game, every training session and in his selection of players he’s put together over the last few years.” 
    

            Harrison’s team has emulated an Ajax side that, featuring the great Johan Cruyff, went on to complete the treble in 1972 by winning the Eredivisie, the Dutch Cup and the European Cup – the precursor to today’s Champions League. 
    

            TNS, by comparison, has never made it past the qualifying rounds of the continent’s top club competition in 10 attempts.
    

      
      

      

    

            Now 21 points clear at the top of the 12-team Welsh Premier League, the team can break the world record when it plays second-bottom Cefn Druids again on Friday. 
    

            

    

            “There’s a lot of hard work going on in the Welsh Premier League,” said Harris, whose team has won the title for the past five seasons. 
    

            “It’s a very young league compared to the more established leagues in Europe, but the clubs have worked really, really hard over the last 20 years to keep pushing forward.

The former No. 1 is returning from hip injury

            An emotional Andy Murray sobbed into his towel on the side of the court after a grueling victory over world No. 93 Marius Copil in Washington – a game that finished at 3 a.m. Friday local time.
    

            Hours later, tournament organizers confirmed
 that Murray had withdrawn from Washington’s Citi Open due to fatigue and would not play in the quarterfinals. He also will not compete in the Rogers Cup next week in Toronto, they said.
    

            “I’m exhausted after playing so much over the past four days, having not competed on the hard courts for 18 months,” Murray said in a statement. “I also need to be careful and to listen to my body as I come from a long-term injury.”
    

            Murray, who continues his return from hip surgery, overcame the Romanian 6-7 6-3 7-6 in his second three-set encounter in two days, having previously defeated fellow Briton Kyle Edmund. 
    
No words, 
. 
Just thanks for your emotions... 😍🙏
 

            “Just the emotions coming at the end of an extremely long day and a long match,” Murray, 31, said of his reaction to the Copil match, after which he sat crying into his towel for several minutes. 
    

            The former world No. 1 had to dig deep after conceding a 5-0 advantage in the first-set tie break to lose 7-5, but Murray twice broke Copil in the second set to force a decider.
    

            

    

            The pair shared breaks in the third set, and as the clock ticked on later into the night, Murray eventually emerged victorious (7-4) in the final tie break – at 3:01 a.m.
    

            The three-time grand slam winner has slipped to world No. 832 during his injury rehab and is now chasing his first ATP title since March 2017.

            Sevilla’s 2-0 loss to PSV Eindhoven in Thursday’s 
 match turned ugly when a pitch invader ran on the field and punched the Spanish club’s goalkeeper Marko Dmitrović at the Philips Stadium in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.
    

            Towards the end of the match, which resulted in PSV being eliminated from the tournament 3-2 on aggregate, the spectator can be seen on video walking up to Dmitrović before throwing a punch at his head.
    

      
      

      

    

            The 6-foot-4-inch Serbian goalkeeper quickly pinned down the pitch invader before security personnel arrived and escorted the assailant off the field.
    

            Dmitrović, who made the start in goal after starter 
 was scratched late due to illness, stayed in the game after the incident.
    

            “He pushed me from behind and then came and got in my face and tried to hit me,” Dmitrović said of the incident. 
    

            “He grazed the side of my nose a little and then honestly, I wanted to hit him back but it’s never pretty. If he really wants to fight let’s go to an event or a sport like boxing or anything. Here, in this sport, these things aren’t deserved but alas.
    

      
      

      

    

            “There’s always fans who are drunk and crazy and an idiot who assaults. This shouldn’t happen and I hope they punish him and anyone else who assaults anyone on the pitch in the future.”
    

            Six-time champion Sevilla cruised past PSV Eindhoven 3-0 in the first leg of the playoff, leaving the Dutch side with a tall task heading into Thursday night’s match.
    

            In the second leg, Luuk de Jong netted a goal in the 77th minute for PSV Eindhoven. 
    

            After the Dmitrović incident, substitute Fabio Silva doubled PSV’s lead five minutes into stoppage time but it was too little, too late as the full-time whistle would be blown shortly after.

            Three-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome has been knocked off his bike in a hit-and-run incident while training near Monaco.
    

            The British cyclist, who won the Tour in 2013, 2015 and 2016, tweeted a picture of his crumpled bike on Tuesday but confirmed he hadn’t been injured.

Just got rammed on purpose by an impatient driver who followed me onto the pavement! Thankfully I'm okay 🙏 Bike totaled. Driver kept going! 

            The Briton was riding in Beausoleil, close to his home in Monaco, when the incident took place. He is currently in training ahead of the Critérium du Dauphiné, an eight-day race in southern France that starts on June 4.
    

            

    

            

    

            The Critérium du Dauphiné forms part of the Kenyan-born cyclist’s preparations for his attempt to win a hat-trick of Tour de France titles, when the world’s most prestigious road race returns for its 104th edition.
    

            Italian cyclist and 2011 Giro d’Italia winner Michele Scarponi was killed in April when he was hit by a van when out on a training ride near his home in Filottrano, on the east coast.
    

            “This is a tragedy too big to be written,” his team Astana said in a statement about Scarponi, who had two young children with his wife Anna.
    

      
      

      

    

            Froome is a divisive figure in France.
    

            With the 
 still hanging over the Tour, Froome has been repeatedly accused of doping even though he insists he has always raced clean.
    

            He has been shouted at and spat on during the race, with one fan even throwing a cup of urine over him during the 2015 installment and calling him a doper.
    

            In an eventful race last year, Froome was fined for lashing out at a spectator who ran too close to him and decided to briefly jog up the famous Mont Ventoux after a crash wiped out his bike.
    

            The 31-year-old Froome says he sees himself as a spokesman for clean cycling and insists the recent controversy surrounding Team Sky will not affect his legacy.
    

            His team has been rocked by a UK Anti-Doping inquiry after revelations that a mystery package was delivered to Bradley Wiggins at an event shortly before his 2011 Tour win.
    

            Team Sky boss Dave Brailsford appeared before a Parliament select committee to reveal the decongestant Fluimucil was in the package bound for Wiggins. 
    

            Questions have also been asked about how Team Sky used therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs), which are essentially doctor’s notes enabling athletes to use medicines that would otherwise be banned.
    

            Wiggins has come under particular scrutiny over his use of TUEs for the banned anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone as well as that package that was delivered by British Cycling coach Simon Cope during the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine tour.
    

            Wiggins has yet to publicly comment on the UKAD inquiry though in March he told Sky Sports’ Soccer AM show: “Fortunately there’s an investigation and I obviously can’t say too much because that will run its course and then I’ll have my say.

            Sarifa Patel’s 500-foot trip to her nearest bus stop takes half an hour. Walking is painful and she needs several breaks. Patel, who lives in east London, has a wheelchair, but since undergoing surgery a few years ago she no longer has the strength to push herself.
    

            The 60-year-old doesn’t want to give up her part-time job at a charity, so requested a mobility scooter through a government scheme aimed at helping disabled people access employment. She has been waiting for three years.
    

            A decade of austerity policies and deep cuts to social services and 
 in the United Kingdom has made it difficult for people like Patel to access the care they need. A 2018 report by a UN human rights expert said government policy has “
 … on people with disabilities who are already marginalized.”
    

            The future is also uncertain. New UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged more money for the cash-strapped National Health Service. Johnson’s hardline approach to Brexit, however, increases the likelihood of the country leaving the European Union without a deal, with potentially damaging economic consequences 
    

            According to forecasts by the 
 and the 
, a no-deal Brexit would likely push the UK into a deep recession and put public spending under pressure. It was the last recession, sparked by the global financial crisis in 2008, that led to the austerity measures that the UN says have decimated Britain’s social services.

    

            For Patel, the situation is difficult now. She 
, a long-term condition that causes pain, muscle spasms and stiffness. Sometimes it is so bad she can’t walk at all. 
    

            “I’ve been really struggling with my knees, but they’ve not listened to me,” she says of her scooter request.
    

            The UK government’s Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), which is responsible for disability benefits, would not comment on Patel’s individual case.
    

      
      

      

    

            If Patel really needs to go somewhere, her only option is to take a cab. Patel spends roughly £200 ($242) a month on taxis. It’s money she says she wouldn’t have to spend if she wasn’t disabled.
    

            That’s a common story. Scope, a UK disability charity, said the average “disability price tag” comes to £583 ($706) a month. 
    

            “That’s the amount disabled people have to spend on things that non-disabled people don’t need,” James Taylor, Scope’s head of policy, told CNN.
    

            This figure includes buying and repairing special equipment, as well as spending money on everyday goods and services that disabled people have to use a lot more often, Taylor said. 
    

            The extra cost has grown in recent years. Following the global economic crisis, successive UK governments attempted to save money by reforming Britain’s welfare system. 
    

            These changes were meant to make the system leaner and more streamlined, replacing “outdated” benefits with new ones. But the reform proved difficult for many people living with disabilities.
    

            “It was designed as more cost-effective and less generous,” Taylor said. 
    

            “We are finding people who were getting the previous benefit are no longer able to get the new one, so there is a group of disabled people who have been hit very hard,” he added.
    

            Latest available DWP 
 show that as of last October, 47% of people who were receiving the old disability benefit, known as Disability Living Allowance, had their payments reduced or scrapped altogether after transferring to the new system, called Personal Independence Payment.
    

            That is intentional: the government expected the reform would mean around 
.
    

      
      

      

    

            It said that the point was to make the system more sustainable and focused on those with the greatest needs.
    

            A DWP spokesperson said the new system is better because it is “taking a much wider look at the way a person’s health condition or disability impacts them on a daily basis.” 
    

            But Scope said some disabled people have lost £300 to £400 a month because of the changes. “That has a huge impact on what they’re able to afford, and the quality of life that they have,” Taylor said. 
    

            Most people switching to the new system have to go through an official assessment to determine the level of care and mobility assistance they need. 
    

            The requirements became stricter under the new system. For example, it used to be that anyone unable to walk 50 meters (164 feet) without aid would qualify for higher mobility support payments.
    

            Under the new system, only people who can’t 
. That means that those who can walk over 20 meters but not 50 have suddenly had their payments slashed, even though their condition has not changed.
    

            A DWP spokesperson said the rule was not set in stone and that even people who can walk more than 20 meters can still get the higher rate if they “cannot do so safely, to an acceptable standard, repeatedly or in a reasonable time period.”
    

            Patel was “downgraded” in 2016. She slumped from “higher” to “standard” support rates, resulting in more than £60 cut to her weekly payments. 
    

            “And then when I spoke to the wheelchair services people, they said I should be able to buy a scooter from the mobility benefit,” Patel said. She said a scooter or electric chair 
. Even if she was able to put money aside, it would take her years to save up enough to buy one. 
    

            She has tried to have the decision to lower her payments overturned and got a new assessment from a different doctor. She is now waiting for a tribunal.
    

      
      

      

    

            The tribunal odds are on Patel’s side. According to the Ministry of Justice, 
 against disability payments decisions are successful.
But the appeal process is time consuming, taking on average almost a year. In the meantime, the person appealing is stuck without funds. 
    

            “It inflicts hardship on people, because in many cases, most or a large portion of their income is withdrawn,” said Sara Reis, research and policy officer at the UK Women’s Budget Group, a research organization. 
    

            “And there will be many people who won’t go through the appeal process because it’s an onerous thing and it can be daunting, intimidating to stand before a tribunal and state your case,” she added.
    

            While she awaits that decision, Patel hopes that when her next big muscle spasm comes, she won’t be out and about. Freezing up in the street makes her feel vulnerable. 
    

            “I get really frustrated and angry because I can be walking… and the next minute, my muscle spasms up in my leg, and it becomes like a pencil… it’s frightening.”

            Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has told Volodymyr Zelensky never to “insult Poles again” after the 
 president suggested his neighbor was putting on a show over their disputes on grain exports.
    

            The Polish leader fired back at Zelensky after the Ukrainian leader offered a veiled criticism of Poland at the United Nations’ general assembly this week, saying the dispute was “political theater” and that “some of our friends in Europe” have “made a thriller from the grain.”
    

            On Friday, at a rally in Swidnik, Poland, Morawiecki hit back.
    

            “I want to tell President Zelensky never to insult Poles again, as he did recently during his speech at the UN,” he said.
    

            “The Polish people will never allow this to happen, and defending the good name of Poland is not only my duty and honor, but also the most important task of the Polish government,” the Polish prime minister added.
    

      
      

      

    

            The comments by Morawiecki risk deepening the divisions between two countries that have previously been close allies united against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
    

            Tensions between them have been rising in recent weeks over a ban on Ukrainian grain, initially put in place earlier this year by several EU nations to protect the livelihood of local farmers worried about being undercut by the low price of Ukrainian grain.
    

            The EU announced plans to suspend the ban last week but 
 – alongside Hungary and Slovakia – said it would stick with it, sparking protests from Ukraine, which filed lawsuits against the three countries, and, subsequently, Zelensky’s comments at the UN.
    

            Poland immediately condemned Zelensky’s comments at the UN and its foreign ministry summoned the Ukrainian ambassador to convey its “strong protest.” Hours later, the Polish prime minister said in a blunt social media statement that the country would “no longer transfer weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland.”
    

            That had seemed to indicate a major change in policy: until now, Poland has been one of the most forthright countries in the race to get weapons and resources into Ukrainian hands.
    

            But Polish President Andrzej Duda on Thursday moved to walk back his prime minister’s comments, saying they were “interpreted in the worst possible way.”
    

            He said Morawiecki had merely been referring to new weapons being purchased for the Polish army, and that older weapons systems Warsaw deems not necessary for modernizing its own military could still be shipped across the border.
    

            NATO and European sources 
 that the Polish stance may be an attempt to woo farmers with elections due next month. 
    

            Poland has long been one of Ukraine’s staunchest allies, alongside multiple former Eastern bloc nations which fear they could be next if Russian President Vladimir Putin’s expansionist war is successful.
    

            In another sign of disenchantment over Ukraine in Eastern Europe, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has said new sanctions against Russia are not needed because they “cause more harm to Europe than Russia.”
    

            Szijjarto made the comments in an interview with Russian state media TASS on Friday following his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. 
    

            “If we look at the sanctions from a pragmatic point of view, we see that they cause more harm to Europe than to Russia,” he said, according to TASS, adding that “the new packages of sanctions are not necessary.” 
    

            Szijjarto also said that supplies of Ukrainian grain to Central European countries will destroy their agricultural sector. 
    

            “If Ukrainian grain starts to spread into Central European countries, it will definitely destroy the agricultural markets of Central Europe. Not to mention our farmers, whom we obviously need to protect,” Szijjarto continued, as cited by TASS.

Award-winning chef works for Williams F1

            When Michael Caines lost his right arm in a car accident in 1994, the dream of becoming a top-level chef seemed a million miles away.
    

            Twenty-three years and two Michelin stars later, he hasn’t just become one of his industry’s most distinguished figures, he’s also fueling some of the fastest drivers in the world.
    

            A partner and ambassador for Formula One team Williams Martini Racing, the 48-year-old hosts the team’s sponsors, engineers and drivers on race weekends. 
    

            “I grew up watching Williams dominate in that era of Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill being made World Champions for this great racing team,” says Caines, who has built an empire of 
 in the United Kingdom.
    

            “You see your heroes on TV and think ‘wow!’ … and the next thing you know, you find yourself in the paddock. 
    

            “It is one of those pinch-yourself moments”
    

            F1 has a relentless race calendar which runs from March to November and stops in 20 major cities. But from Australia to Abu Dhabi, the Brit shows it’s possible to produce top-quality cuisine on the move. 
    

            “They say an army marches on its stomach and Williams is no exception,” Caines tells CNN The Circuit. 
    

            “We’ve got to produce nutritious and healthy food for the drivers, but we’ve also got to provide for the sponsors over the F1 weekend.” 
    

            His team designed a purpose-built motorhome four years ago to deliver a bespoke product for the Williams team and its numerous guests.  
    

            It can be quickly assembled at any location on the F1 circuit to deliver the optimum culinary experience, with a ground floor brasserie and first floor Michael Caines Tasting Experience.
    

            It might not be perfect, but as the chef puts it: “We get pretty close to what I do in my restaurants here on the track!”
    
Want to see what happens in the Williams Martini Racing kitchen? Williams TV takes you behind the scenes with

            Caines stresses the importance of a good diet for drivers, especially since this year’s new rulings have made the sport even more physically demanding. 
    

            Even if Williams drivers Felipe Massa and Lance Stroll probably won’t be troubling the top of the drivers’ standings at the end of this season, there’s little doubt the British team is well catered for especially, says Caines, when compared with what their rivals offer. 
    

            “There’s no competition!” laughs Caines. “We out-qualify all of them!”
    

            “Toto Wolff will tell you. The first thing he said when he went to Mercedes was ‘we want our hospitality to be just like Williams’.”
    

            

    

            Not that Massa and Stroll are devouring
 before races. 
    

            Because drivers are out on the road so much, the most important ingredient is a taste of home.
    

            Both eat at a particular time on race weekends – “written in as part of the day” – and tend to not change their diet. 
    

            Stroll, an F1 debutant of Canadian descent, typically eats quinoa and high protein fish, like salmon or cod. 
    

            Massa, the first Brazilian since Ayrton Senna to win his home Grand Prix, rarely deviates from a dish of roast chicken, wild rice and tomato salad.
    

            “Everyone has to be made to feel welcome,” says Caines. “When they’re not having to worry about racing, they’ll also indulge off the menu!”
    

            

    

            The chef admits sponsors are “so key to survival” for today’s F1 teams.
    

            It’s a fact Williams has embraced, going through 2,000 bottles of Prosecco over the course of the 2016 season.
    

            “If results aren’t always what they should be on the track, at least through hospitality you can give the sponsors a great experience throughout the race weekend,” says Caines. 
    

            “I’m always thinking about how we can bring in different themes to different grands prix, whether that’s the cocktails or the food. 
    

            “We always try to influence that with the wine choices as well – English wines going alongside some of the dishes too.”
    

            The opportunity to experiment is offset by the difficulty obtaining ingredients in some race locations. 
    

            He praises the produce on offer in Monaco, lauding “the fantastic larder of fantastic seafood and salads,” but adds it can be slightly more challenging cooking in the likes of Russia and Hungary. 
    

            Still, with opportunity to watch races in between his cooking, Caines is in no doubt as to just how lucky he is. 
    

            “I derive a lot of satisfaction from the fact that something I loved as a kid is something I’m now in touch with,” he smiles. 
    

            

    

            “It’s a team sport and it goes without saying that everyone involved with Williams is here to support the team to go on, race and hopefully win.”

            Zookeepers in the British city of Bristol
are giving a baby 
 round-the-clock care, including bottle feeding through the night, as his mother has been struggling to look after him.
    

            The team of keepers at Bristol Zoo Gardens said
that the baby, now two months old but still unnamed, was not getting enough milk from his mother, Kala, to survive and would now be hand-reared for the next four months.
    

            “Hand-rearing any animal is not a decision we take lightly as our preference is always for an animal to be reared naturally by its own mother,” Lynsey Bugg, mammals curator at the zoo, said in a statement. 
    

            “Sadly, this doesn’t always happen and in this instance we decided that it was in the baby gorilla’s best interests for us to hand rear him to ensure he had the best chance of survival.” 
    

            Kala, the baby’s mother, is said to be adjusting well and is in good health. 
    

            Bugg said that when the infant is away from his mother at night in onsite accommodation, zookeepers will try to treat him like his gorilla mother would, expecting him to hold on tight to them and making gorilla vocalizations.
    

            During the day, the infant will be in the zoo’s Gorilla House. It is hoped that if the animals are able to see, smell, touch, and be near him, the infant will soon be able to bond with the group and be accepted as a part of the family, the statement said.
    

            Zookeepers are keeping the baby gorilla out of public view for now, but visitors can view the rest of the group.
    

            The zoo invited members of the public to help choose a name 
. The options are: Motuku, meaning “Chief of the Village” in Bubi, a local language in Equatorial Guinea; Hasani, meaning “handsome” in Swahili; Luango, a town on the coast of Equatorial Guinea; or Kidosi, popular Central African name.

            Germany’s top prosecutor has accused 
 of ordering the murder of a Georgian man in a Berlin park, as they announced that a suspected contract killer has been charged over the killing. 
    

            The victim was a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of 
 descent named by German officials as Tornike K. He was shot dead by a man on a bicycle in downtown Berlin’s Kleiner Tiergarten park on August 23, 2019. Previously named as 
, the former Chechen fighter had been on his way to midday prayers.
    

            A Russian national was arrested within hours over the killing, setting off a murder mystery that has gripped Germany.
    

            While the Kremlin has denied any connection between the murder and the Russian state, the shooting triggered an investigation which also raised uncomfortable questions about the relationship between the two countries.
    

      
      

      

    

            Germany’s federal prosecutor took over the investigation in December. On Thursday, almost ten months after the murder, they said they had gathered sufficient evidence and brought charges against the suspect.
    

            “At an unknown date before July 18, 2019, the accused received the order from authorities at the central government of the Russian Federation to liquidate the Georgian national of Chechen origin,” the prosecutor’s statement reads.
    

            The suspect, named as Vladim K., is accused of the murder and of illegal possession of a weapon, the statement added.
    

            “The indictment by the federal prosecutor contains serious accusations regarding the involvement of Russian state authorities in the so-called Tiergarten murder case,” a German government spokesperson said Thursday, adding: “The Federal Government takes this very seriously.”
    

            The spokesperson said the German government would “carefully monitor” the rest of the trial until a verdict was reached, adding that two members of the Russian embassy were expelled in December in connection to the case, and that recently Germany had taken steps against Russia in connection with the hacking attack on the German Bundestag in 2015. 
    

            “The German government reserves the right to take further steps,” the statement concluded.

            There was a sense of urgency in the voice of the man claiming to be 
 defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian.
    

             “We’re talking about the lives of 
 citizens and we would like to free them. If we don’t, we expect the worst,” the man said in an audio recording of a telephone solicitation obtained by CNN. 
    

            “I need to know if you can join us in this mission so we can carry it out and if the answer is ‘yes’ then I will alert the presidency to say we have someone who can act as a mediator for us.” 
    

            On the receiving end of the telephone line was Olivier de Boisset, a Frenchman who heads an IT company in Niger.
    

            De Boisset was being asked to wire over 2 million dollars to allegedly help free French hostages being held by terrorists in Mali.
    

            The voice said France needed de Boisset’s help transferring funds because officially the country does not pay ransoms and gave assurances that France’s central bank would reimburse him.
    

            De Boisset was suspicious, but he could never have imagined the extent of the scam that was being played on him.
    

            Not only were there no French hostages in Mali, but he had just become the latest victim in a multi-million dollar con that would span two years and target more than 150 people including the spiritual leader Aga Khan, the President of Niger, the Prime Minister of Norway, the Archbishop of Lyon, the owner of Chateau Margaux wines, the King of Belgium, the director general of UNESCO and numerous CEOs.
    

            Attempts to extort money from embassies and governments were made in more than 50 countries, according to French court documents.
    

            CNN has obtained exclusive recordings made by often-skeptical victims showing how a group of fraudsters tried to pull off what some in France are calling the scam of the century by impersonating France’s then defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, and conning wealthy individuals out of 80 million euros purportedly to help pay ransoms to free French hostages being held by Islamist terrorists.
    

            Some of the money has not been recovered.
    

            Six of the alleged fraudsters are currently on trial in Paris in connection with the Le Drian hoax and a plot to impersonate Prince Albert II of Monaco while a seventh defendant is on trial only for the Albert of Monaco plot. 
    

            According to many of the victims, to earn their trust an initial phone call was followed up by a Skype video call. During this exchange, the con artist wore a custom-made silicone mask of Le Drian’s face and sat in a replica of the minister’s office complete with both the tricolor flag of France and a flag of Europe, pictures in the court documents show.
    

            Another one of those targeted in June 2016 by the bogus Le Drian was Bruno Paillard, who heads a champagne house in Reims, northern France.
    

            Paillard told CNN the hustle was impressive because of its elaborate nature. “The image was not very precise and the voice was a little bit strange. The excuse was that they were in a bunker in the ministry,” Paillard said.
    

            In addition to the Skype calls, Paillard said they communicated with him on official-looking letterheads from the ministry, but despite all their efforts Paillard said he wasn’t convinced and went straight to the police. 
    

            “As a champagne producer we make people happy, but we’re not necessarily good at saving the lives of people who are being held in strange countries,” Paillard told CNN.
    

            Paillard said the fake Le Drian had done his homework, he even knew how many children he had.
    

            Wine maker Guy-Petrus Lignac was equally astonished at how much the fraudsters knew about him. He said they drew on his background to appeal to his sense of patriotism.  
    

      
      

      

    

            “They knew so many things about me! That I had been a police officer in the past. That’s not common knowledge, it’s not on the internet. I was surprised,” Lignac told CNN. 
    

            Many of the victims were skeptical and went to the defense ministry to report the calls. The ministry alerted investigators in the summer of 2015 and an investigation was opened in April 2016, according to court documents.
    

            Lawyers for Le Drian said French embassies all over the world were warned of the scam in 2016. However, the ministry didn’t see the need for a press conference. 
    

            Turkish businessman Inan Kirac, was duped in November 2016 and over the course of one month handed over $47 million in nine transfers to bank accounts in China – the largest sum to be wired to the fraudsters by one individual.
    

            Kirac eventually realized he was being scammed and began taping the conversations.
    

            In an audio recording obtained by CNN Kirac is heard speaking with a man impersonating an aide to Le Drian.
    

            “Mr. Kirac, first of all, I wanted to express my condolences concerning the attack in Istanbul and I learned that two of your very close friends were injured in this attack,” the voice on the crackly line is heard saying.
    

            “I hope that 2016 will be a good year to defeat crime and the terrorists who deserve to go to hell,” the man said.
    

            Kirac believed his money was being used to free two French journalists who were allegedly being held hostage in Syria.
    

            Delphine Meillet, the lawyer representing the actual Le Drian, who is now France’s foreign minister, told CNN the fraudsters used the war in Syria to their advantage. 
    

            “There were real hostages at the time, in 2015, and the technique to convince them was to play on fears of terrorism,” Meillet said.
    

            “When the state asks you to do it a favor, to help fight terrorism, how can you say no? How can you say no to a minister?” she added.
    

      
      

      

    

            The voice of the fake Le Drian is allegedly that of Gilbert Chikli, according to prosecutors, a Franco-Israeli accused of being the mastermind behind the sting. He is charged with organized fraud and usurping a person’s identity. Chikli denies the charges.
    

            Meillet describes the 54-year-old as being a modern-day Victor Lustig, the notorious con man who sold the Eiffel Tower to a scrap-metal dealer in 1925, not once but twice.
    

            Chikli has a checkered past. In 2015, he was sentenced in absentia to seven years in prison for a brazen scam where he posed as prominent French CEOs in order to extort millions of euros from companies. The hoax was later the subject of a movie “Thank You for Calling” that paid Chikli as a consultant, according to court documents. 
    

            In 2017 the Parisian was arrested in Ukraine and according to court documents evidence was found on Chikli’s cell phone showing that Google searches for “silicone mask Kiev” and “Prince of Monaco” had been made.”
    

            Another defendant in the trial, Anthony Lasarevitsch, was arrested in Kiev alongside Chikli. Investigators found pictures of a silicone mask of Prince Albert II of Monaco on his cell phone.
    

            Lasarevitsch faces the same charges as Chikli, and denies any wrongdoing. His lawyer said in court that Lasarevitsch had been “dragged into the case by the media” after his arrest alongside Chikli “was broadcast to the masses.”
    

            A clip of Chikli, while incarcerated in Kiev, surfaced on social media in 2017 showing him having a fridge delivered to the prison. In the video Chikli says “this is what I’ve bought, a fridge, so I can eat some entrecote. We are the bosses!”
    

            Chikli was eventually extradited to France. He is currently in prison serving time for the CEO hoax. He’s admitted taking part in the CEO scam but says he’s not the mastermind.
    

            On Monday experts testified that the voice of the fake Le Drian bore a striking resemblance to that of Chikli.
    

            Chikli defended himself vehemently in court Monday.
    

            “What can I tell you? They’ve got it wrong!” he shouted.  
    

            “There are 20 billion cases like this per year, I’ve got nothing to do with this! I have no answers to your questions,” Chikli growled.
    

            His lawyer, Stephane Sebag, told CNN that the whole of the prosecution was based on weak analysis of the voice samples from Chikli’s interviews and that the recordings of the scam “are very poor.”
    

            “This is not enough to convince anyone of his guilt,” Sebag said.
    

            If convicted Chikli faces up to 14 years in prison and a 2 million euro fine. A verdict is expected on March 11.
    

            The real Le Drian reacted to the scam last year. “You can’t impersonate me, if you do then you go to prison,” he said.
    

            “They were pretty convincing and sadly there were victims. They did a good job of imitating my voice,” Le Drian added.

            It is being spearheaded by world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and 94th-ranked Vasek Pospisil, who said it is “very difficult, if not impossible, to have any significant impact on any major decisions” within the current structure alongside the ATP. 
    

            Djokovic, who continued his unbeaten streak in 2020 as he won the Western & Southern Open in New York, also said the current setup is “quite complex.”
    

            He told reporters after his victory over 
: “This is not a new idea. This hasn’t been something that came out of the blue. This has been a project for many players and many different generations over the last 20-plus years.
    

            “I certainly think it’s the right step forward for the players, because I think it unifies the players. It allows them to have a platform, to have an association through which they will be able to express themselves better where they will be able to talk about the ideas, the interests, and the things that are related to the players.”
    

            He added that he believes the PTPA can coexist alongside the ATP Tour, but in a statement the governing body of men’s tennis underlined the need for unity within the sport.
    

            

    

            “The governance structure of the ATP Tour provides players with equal seats at the table on every major decision affecting the circuit. We recognize the challenges that our members face in today’s circumstances,” the statement read.
    

            “However we strongly believe that now is a time for unity, rather than internal division. We remain unwavering in our commitment to deliver for our players across all areas of our business, ensuring they receive maximum benefit from their years on Tour, and that their voices are heard.
    

            “In parallel, we remain committed to working closely with the other governing bodies of tennis as we look to fulfill the true potential of our sport. Only as a unified sport can we truly focus on the fan experience, engage new audiences, and ensure that tennis continues to thrive.”
    

            Federer and Nadal, the most decorated players in the men’s game, spoke out against the PTPA.
    

      
      

      

    

            “The world is living a difficult and complicated situation. I personally believe these are times to be calm and work all of us together in the same direction. It is time for unity, not for separation,” Nadal said on social media.
    

            “These are moments where big things can be achieved as long as the world of tennis is united. We all, players, tournaments and governing bodies, have to work together. We have a bigger problem and separation and disunion is definitely not the solution.”
    

            

    

            Federer, who earlier this year called for tennis to merge its men’s and women’s governing bodies, agreed that it is time “to stand united as players, and as a sport,” while three-time grand slam champion Andy Murray questioned the absence of female players in the new association.
    

            Pospisil said there is “active dialogue with the women’s side” to incorporate female players in the PTPA. 
    

            The launch of the association comes on the eve of the 
, which gets underway in Flushing Meadows on Monday.
    

            A number of top players will not play in the tournament amid the coronavirus pandemic, including Federer and Nadal on the men’s side and top-ranked Ashleigh Barty and Simona Halep on the women’s. 
    

            Djokovic and Murray, who continues his return from a career-threatening hip injury, will compete in the men’s draw, while Naomi Osaka and Serena Williams are among the high-profile participants in the women’s singles. 
    

            As in the NBA and the Champions League, players will live in bubbles around New York, either in tournament-sanctioned hotels or private accommodation.

            A day after being controversially 
 from the 
 for inadvertently hitting a ball girl with a ball, an emotional 
struggled to answer questions about the incident. 
    

            Kato and her partner Aldila Sutjiadi were defaulted from the doubles event on Sunday after the Japanese player struck a ball girl having innocuously hit the ball to the back of the court following a point.
    

      
      

      

    

            Kato, who was seen crying on court after her disqualification, was back in action on Monday and reached the mixed doubles semifinals after winning in straight sets alongside German partner Tim Puetz. 
    

            It’s widely reported that Kato was in tears on court after winning the quarterfinal and was visibly emotional in the press conference afterward, leaving the room momentarily to compose herself before a question was answered. 
    

            “I think, first and foremost, we’re all, including Miyu, happy that the ball girl is okay because obviously she got hit,” Puetz told reporters after coming back into the room with Kato. 
    

            “Miyu feels terrible about what happened. This was just very unfortunate for everyone, especially for her and the girl.” 
    

            A tearful Kato gave a very short answer in Japanese, saying it was difficult for her to speak English at this time. 
    

            While Puetz understood why officials made the decision, he said there was clearly no intent to hurt the ball girl. 
    

            “I understand she hit the ball girl. It was not intentional. I don’t think it was in anger,” he added.
    

            “I think everybody saw the pictures. It wasn’t anything malicious that she did. Nevertheless, it hit the ball girl.
    

            “Then two supervisors have to come on court, possibly didn’t even see it. All they see is a crying ball girl who got hit with a ball. 
    

            “In that moment, to make that decision, is very difficult.”
    

            On Monday, Kato tweeted an apology to the ball girl, her doubles partner and her supporters, saying the incident was

    

            “I want to thank everyone for your continued support. I have received a worldwide outpouring of positive energy, and it has raised my spirits tremendously,” she

            “Now I’m onto the mixed doubles semifinals, where I will use every bit of that positive energy to succeed!” 
    

            According to the grand slam rule book, players “shall not violently, dangerously or with anger hit, kick or throw a tennis ball within the precincts of the tournament site except in the reasonable pursuit of a point during a match (including warm-up)”
    

            The rule book states: “In all cases of default, the decision of the referee in consultation with the grand slam chief of supervisors shall be final and unappealable.”

            The chairman of a leading German football club is under growing pressure to resign after making racist comments about African people during a speech last week.
    

            Schalke chairman Clemens Tönnies criticized tax increases to fight climate change while speaking at a
festival in the western city of Paderborn, suggesting instead that money be used to fund power plants in Africa.
    

            “Then the Africans would stop cutting down trees and stop producing children when it’s dark,” Tönnies was quoted as saying by regional German 

    

            He has since apologized for his remarks and said he supports Schalke’s values against “racism, discrimination and exclusion.”
    

            The club told CNN that their ethics body will be discussing his remarks soon, in an upcoming meeting.  
    

            “I would like to explicitly apologize to you, the fans, members and friends of FC Schalke 04,” Tönnies said in 
on the club’s website. “It was wrong, thoughtless … and in no way met our mission statement. I am very sorry.” 
    

      
      

      

    

            But politicians and some fans of the Bundesliga club have urged him to quit, and the German Football Association (DFB) is under pressure to discipline the businessman.
    

            Germany’s Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht has led calls for Tönnies’ comments to be punished. “Racism must be loudly and clearly contradicted,” she told newspapers of the Funke media group. 
    

            “Nowhere is integration as successful and quick to work as in sport – that must not be put at risk,” Lambrecht added.
    

            SDP lawmaker Markus Töns 
: “The racist statement by Clemens Tönnies at the “Day of Crafting” in Paderborn is incompatible with the mission statement of Schalke 04.”
    

            And Dagmar Freitag, who chairs the sports committee in Germany’s parliament, argued that Tönnies’ apology cannot make up for the damage his remarks caused.
    

            “That something like this (is) articulated by someone who holds a prominent position in the sport makes things even worse,” she told German newspaper Welt, adding that his explanation “certainly can not make up for the socio-political damage.” 
    

            CNN has asked the DFB for comment.

French defender strikes 13 minutes from time as holders suffer defeat at home stadium
Cristiano Ronaldo had given Real the lead before Carles Puyol equalized
Milan beat Novara to progress into the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup

            A late goal from Eric Abidal gave Barcelona a 2-1 comeback victory in the first leg of their Spanish Cup quarterfinal clash with arch rivals Real Madrid.
    

            The French defender scored the decisive goal in the match known as ‘El Clasico’ at Real’s Bernabeu stadium after Barcelona captain Carles Puyol had canceled out Cristiano Ronaldo’s opener.
    

            It means Barcelona are favorites to progress into the final four of the competition and eliminate the holders when the two contest the second leg next Wednesday.
    

            After a cagey opening, in which Barcelona dominated possession, Real took the lead with their first meaningful attack on 11 minutes.
    

            Karim Benzema’s pass found Ronaldo scampering through the middle, and the Portuguese forward stepped past Gerard Pique before firing beyond Barca keeper Pinto.
    

            Ronaldo, who has been criticized by some fans for not celebrating some of his recent goals and for missing several chances in the last match with Barca, certainly looked like he enjoyed his opener.
    

            Five minutes later Barcelona striker Alexis Sanchez, from Chile, got on the end of Cesc Fabregas’ pass but though his looping header beat Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas, it bounced back off the post.
    

            Lionel Messi had his first sight of goal on 26 minutes as his low shot forced Casillas into a smart save at his near post. Andres Iniesta then made some room inside the penalty area but he fired wide after Sanchez’s lay off.
    

            But just three minutes into the second half Barcelona pulled level as their captain Carles Puyol stooped to head a corner into the net.
    

            Moments later Real defender Sergio Ramos deflected a volley from Iniesta onto the woodwork after a chipped pass from Fabregas.
    

            Real then hit the woodwork themselves as Benzema’s header cannoned back off the upright with Pinto beaten.
    

            Tempers frayed when Real’s Pepe appeared to stamp on Messi’s hand as the Argentine was on the floor after a foul before Barca edged in front with just over ten minutes to go.
    

            Abidal, who signed a new contract at the club this week, controlled Messi’s pass on his chest before shooting low into the net.
    

            In Italy, 
progressed to the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup but they needed extra time to beat Novara 2-1.
    

            Stephan El Shaarawy gave the Rossoneri the lead on 24 minutes with a curling shot but Ivan Radovanovic equalized for Serie A’s bottom club with a long range free kick two minutes from time.

            The Formula One season is the longest it has ever been.
    

            In 2018, for the second time in three years, drivers and teams have competed over the course of a 21-race season, spending more time away from families and homes.
    

            Now, with the announcement of a Vietnamese Grand Prix being added to the calendar from 2020, Lewis Hamilton has expressed his concern that the season is becoming unbearably long.
    

            

    

            

    

            “I am not going to be here if it gets to 25 races, that’s for sure,” Hamilton told reporters. 
    

            “It already feels like we are on race 25 this year, so I don’t think that’s a good thing. I think 18 was probably the best back in the day.”
    

            Despite next year also featuring 21 races, the schedule in 2019 means the F1 calendar will run into December for the first time in over 50 years.
    

            Liberty Media, the company that has owned Formula One since January 2017, has often expressed its hopes of expanding the season further.
    

            “I’m someone who really loves racing but the season is long,” Hamilton said. “It’s a lot of commitment for all of us and a lot of time away from families, and the seasons are getting longer and the off time is getting shorter.
    

            “All I can do is speak is for myself. The turnaround is so short, you start preparing for your next season often as soon as the season is done. 
    

            “Getting your mind turned. That’s very difficult. Then you have to find a way of switching off and recovering at the same time.”
    

            Hamilton wrapped up his fifth world title in Mexico a fortnight ago but the constructors’ championship is still to be decided.
    

            Ferrari must better Mercedes’ score in Brazil this weekend by 13 points or more if they want the title race to go to the season finale in Abu Dhabi.

2014-08-28 11:52:00+00:00,,"White House: Obama, Merkel agree Russian convoy is ""a provocation""
UK ambassador: Convoy ""has nothing to do with humanitarianism""
Lithuania official: Consul kidnapped, killed by ""terrorists""
Putin blames Ukraine, says it'd be ""unacceptable"" to delay sending convoy

            Is it an act of compassion or one of belligerence? 
    

            Both judgments were offered Friday on the dozens of Russian trucks that have rolled into eastern Ukraine, a move Russian leaders cast as necessary to address a humanitarian crisis and a Ukrainian official characterized as an “invasion” of his nation by its mighty neighbor to the east.
    

            While getting agreement on the right answer is impossible at this moment, there’s little doubt the actions have raised tensions to new levels – and that’s saying something, given the volatility over the past many months.
    

            The latest row revolves around aid going from Russia to Ukraine. Kiev had stalled trucks on the Russian side of the border for days, before acknowledging Sunday that the convoy, in fact, had humanitarian aid.
    

            That admission didn’t end the discord and debate. As of 11:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET) Friday, 227 Russian vehicles had crossed into Ukraine, according to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has an observer mission at the checkpoint the convoy went through.
    

            All the vehicles were supposed to be monitored by members of the International Committee of the Red Cross. However, the Red Cross said it wasn’t accompanying them due to the “volatile security situation” – a reference to continued fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian forces.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of directly and indirectly bolstering the rebel movement. The Kiev-based government and its allies – including the NATO alliance and its core member, the United States – see this convoy as perhaps Moscow’s most glaring, egregious move yet.
    

            “We call this a direct invasion for the first time under cynical cover of the Red Cross,” said Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, the head of Ukraine’s security service.
    

            Right now, Ukraine isn’t planning to go after the convoy. Still, Nalyvaychenko thinks its main purpose is to supply rebels and its drivers are not even civilians.
    

            To Russian President Vladimir Putin, it is Ukraine’s government – not his – that’s being irresponsible and fueling instability in eastern Ukraine. 
    

            Putin expressed “serious concern” to German Chancellor Angela Merkel about endangered civilians and other impacts from Ukraine’s “continued (military) escalation,” according to the Kremlin.
    

            He further criticized what he characterized as “Kiev’s blatant attempts to hinder the delivery of Russian humanitarian aid” into southeast Ukraine, implying he had no choice but to act.
    

            “Further delay would have been unacceptable,” a Kremlin statement said.
    

            

    

            The international community hardly embraced Putin’s version of events.
    

            The British ambassador to the United Nations said that Russia had no support at a U.N. Security Council meeting Friday on the topic. The diplomat, Mark Lyall Grant, made no doubt about his own country’s views on the convoy’s entrance into Ukraine.
    

            “It is an undeniable and blatant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and clear breach of international law and the U.N. charter,” Lyall Grant told reporters. “It has nothing to do with humanitarianism.”
    

            NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned that the the “so-called humanitarian convoy … can only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel.”
    

            “The disregard of international humanitarian principles raises further questions about whether the true purpose of the aid convoy is to support civilians or to resupply armed separatists,” Rasmussen said in a statement.       
    

            Merkel talked not only with Putin – during which she voiced her “grave concern” – but also with U.S. President Barack Obama.
    

            The two leaders agreed that Ukraine “has continued to deteriorate since the tragic downing” of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, purportedly by pro-Russian rebels, the White House said. The pair concurred, too, that the convoy “is a further provocation and a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty” and called for the stop “of Russian personnel, military equipment and armored vehicles into eastern Ukraine.”
    

            Other U.S. officials laid into Russia publicly.
    

            Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said that Moscow has been told in “very, very clear (terms) that they should not be doing this under the guise of a humanitarian convoy, to use that as an excuse to cross the border in a non-authorized way.”
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “Russia must remove its vehicles and its personnel from the territory of Ukraine immediately,” Kirby told reporters. “Failure to do so will result in additional costs and isolation.”
    

        Russia must remove its vehicles and its personnel from the territory of Ukraine immediately.
    

            Pentagon spokesman John Kirby
        

            This view was seconded by Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, who deemed the convoy – which he said his nation and its allies are tracking closely – “as part of a pattern of flagrant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.” The more Moscow does such things that stir instability in Ukraine, the more it will pay, according to Rhodes.
    

            “If (Russia does) not remove the convoys, we will be making determinations with our international partners about how to ratchet up the costs and consequences on them,” Rhodes said.
    

            

    

            It’s not just the Russian vehicles that crossed into Ukraine that are causing consternation. So, too, are the Russian troops massed at the border.
    

            There were up to 18,000 such “combat-ready” troops on Friday, a significant increase from previous public estimates by the Pentagon, according to a U.S. defense official with direct access to the latest information. 
    

            The official described the units as being in a “fully combat-capable offensive posture.”
    

            A second U.S. official said that many of the units were positioned at “crossroads and towns” two to 10 miles from the border. 
    

            “They are definitely more overt, aggressive and out in the open,” the official said. “They aren’t even hiding it.”
    

            The second official said the United States has believed for weeks that some Russian troops have crossed the border as part of the convoys of military gear and weapons moving from Russia into Ukraine.
    

            Of particular concern is the apparent transport of long-range and advanced systems including at least two SA-22 surface-to-air missile system and a number of pieces of longer-range artillery.
    

            The fear is that any advance of any kind could make the ongoing fighting – sparked last year by a political crisis over whether Ukraine would seek closer ties with Europe or Russia – even worse. U.N. officials estimate that more than 2,000 people have died and nearly 5,000 have been wounded in eastern Ukraine since mid-April.
    

            The dead include Mykola Zelenec, Lithuania’s honor consul in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk, who Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said had been “kidnapped and brutally killed by terrorists.”
    

            Ukraine has time and again accused Russia of effectively fomenting rebellion by supporting rebels – including militarily – in eastern Ukraine, some of whom continue to hold territory there despite a push by Ukraine’s military.
    

            Russia has denied any direct support for the rebels while voicing sympathy for their fight for self-determination, saying that Kiev is in the wrong for its actions that endanger civilians – including many ethnic Russians.
    

            Even if the Russian military doesn’t explicitly march into Ukraine, there are concerns that it will find other ways to bolster the rebels.
    

            Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, insisted Friday that the current humanitarian convoy won’t be one of them.
    

            He told reporters that Russia received “official acceptance by Kiev authorities” for the convoy, and that Moscow is staying in touch with Ukrainian officials to make sure there are no problems in the process of distribution of the aid.

12th person arrested Sunday, Metropolitan Police say

            Muslim women linked arms along Westminster Bridge Sunday in a show of solidarity with the victims of last week’s London terror attack.
    

            The women, many of whom wore blue to symbolize peace, were joined by supporters who stood in silence for five minutes as Big Ben struck 4 p.m.
    

            Four days prior, lone attacker Khalid Masood rammed a car into pedestrians on the bridge, killing three and leaving dozens injured.
    

            He crashed the vehicle before later stabbing an on-duty police officer in the grounds of Parliament. 
    

            Masood was shot dead by police at the scene. A fourth victim died later in the week, when his life support was withdrawn.
    

            The vigil, which was organized by the Women’s March on London, came after a photo of a woman wearing an Islamic head covering crossing the bridge in the aftermath of the attack went viral on social media. 
    

            Some commentators criticized what they perceived to be the woman’s indifference to an injured victim in the image. 
    

            The woman in the photograph released a statement Friday to set the record straight.
    

      
      

      

    

            “Not only have I been devastated by witnessing the aftermath of a shocking and numbing terror attack, I’ve also had to deal with the shock of finding my picture plastered all over social media by those who could not look beyond my attire, who draw conclusions based on hate and xenophobia,” she 
, a UK-based organization which monitors anti-Muslim attacks.
    

            “My thoughts at that moment were one of sadness, fear, and concern,” the unnamed woman said in a statement. 
    

    

            “What the image does not show is that I had talked to other witnesses to try and find out what was happening, to see if I could be of any help… My thoughts go out to all the victims and their families.”
    

            The photographer who took the photo has spoken out in the woman’s defense. 
    

            “The people who took on that picture are being rather selective,” freelance photographer Jamie Lorriman

            In all, twelve people were arrested in relation to the attack. The latest was a 30-year old man who was detained Sunday in Birmingham “on suspicion of preparation of terrorist acts” under the TACT or Terrorism Act 2000, Metropolitan Police said.
    

            Nine people who had been arrested earlier have been released “with no further action.”
    

            A 58-year-old man who was arrested Thursday in Birmingham remains in custody. A 32-year-old woman, arrested in Manchester, is out on bail, pending further inquiries. 
    

            Investigators do not currently see a direct ISIS hand in last week’s attack in London, a British counterterrorism official told CNN on Saturday. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Khalid Masood was active on the encryption messaging service WhatsApp two minutes before he started his attack Wednesday on Westminster Bridge, but no evidence has emerged to show he was communicating with ISIS at any point, the official told CNN. 
    

            Investigators are looking into communications he had with individuals leading up to the attack 
, the official added. 
    

            Investigators are still assessing whether the attacker plotted alone or acted as part of a broader conspiracy. They’re continuing to probe his contacts in radical circles in Birmingham, Luton and London, the official told CNN. 
    

            Authorities are investigating how the perpetrator, who used multiple aliases, became radicalized. He was born Adrian Russell Ajao but also used the name Adrian Elms, police said Friday. 
    

            Born in Kent, Masood had previous convictions, including some for violent offenses, but none for terrorism, police said. His most recent conviction was in 2003 for possession of a knife.
    

      
      

      

    

            The Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia issued a statement Saturday saying Masood visited Saudi Arabia from November 2005 to November 2006 and from April 2008 to April 2009, when he worked as an English teacher. He also obtained a visa and visited Saudi Arabia from March 3 to 8, 2015, the statement said. 
    

            

    

            In addition to four deaths, this week’s attack
wounded at least 50 others, 31 of whom needed hospital treatment, Rowley said. Two people are in critical condition, and another has life-threatening injuries. 
    

            American tourist Kurt Cochran and college administrator Aysha Frade, a British citizen with Spanish roots, as well as Palmer died Wednesday. A fourth victim, Leslie Rhodes, 75, from Streatham in south London, died Thursday night after his life support was withdrawn, according to the Metropolitan Police.

            The couple ran a recording studio in West Bountiful, near Salt Lake City.
    

            The Metropolitan Police issued a statement from their family Monday in which they said Melissa’s health is improving. 
    

            “So many people have been so kind, and we are deeply touched by their goodness and generosity. Your notes, prayers, donations and love have helped us so much,” they said.
    

            “The most difficult part of all of this is that Kurt is no longer with us, and we miss him terribly. He was an amazing individual who loved everyone and tried to make the world a better place. He left a legacy of generosity and service that continues to inspire us.

Oakmont hosts record ninth U.S. Open
Phil Mickelson seeks first win after six runners-up spots

            Oakmont is a golf course without any water hazards, but that all changed as thunderstorms and torrential rain washed out most of the opening round of the 2016 U.S. Open.
    

            The revered track outside Pittsburgh became waterlogged as storms caused three separate weather delays before play was called off for the day.
    

            

    

            Only nine players finished their first round and more than half the field were yet to start, leaving American qualifier Andrew Landry, the world No. 624, top of the leaderboard.
    

            The 28-year-old was three under par playing the final hole, one shot clear of world No. 4 Bubba Watson and Danny Lee, when the hooter went for the final time at 1551 ET on Friday.
    
No more ⛳️ for today. 
 

            American amateur Scottie Scheffler shot 69 to finish one under alongside Kevin Streelman, Lee Westwood and Harris English. 
    

            Defending champion Jordan Spieth was one over after 11, with third-ranked 2011 winner Rory McIlroy four over alongside Masters champion Danny Willett. 
    

            World No. 5 Rickie Fowler had a difficult day and was six over after 12 at the end.
    
Oakmont is hard enough if you hit the fairway...have to drive it better! Looking 4ward to relaxing and getting back after it in the morning!

            

    

            During the first delay, several players, including England’s Westwood and Luke Donald and Germany’s Martin Kaymer, sought refuge in the media center to watch 
 in the Euro 2016 soccer tournament. 
    

            “It’s obviously a frustrating day having to keep coming off, but there’s nothing you can do about the weather,” said Westwood, who eagled the par-four 14th. 
    
📱, ⚽️, 💤 and everything else that goes on during a weather delay. 

            Among those still to start was Phil Mickelson, celebrating his 46th birthday, who is seeking a first U.S. Open title after a record six runner-up spots. 
    

            

    

            Victory in his national championship would make the popular left-hander  the sixth player to win the career grand slam of all four major titles.  
    

            Only Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods have achieved the feat, and Mickelson admitted earlier this week it plays on his mind.
    

            “This is the tournament I want to win most to complete the four majors,” the American told reporters. “I think about it all the time.
    

            “I have to put that out of my head, be patient and not think about results.”
    

            Mickelson, who won the last of his five major titles at the British Open in 2013, added: “I’m excited. I view this week as a great opportunity to complete something that would be historic in my mind.”
    

            

    

            The Californian came into the tournament under something of a cloud after agreeing to return almost $1m he made in profit from an insider trading tip.
    

            “After a multiple-year investigation which led to nothing, no charges or anything, I think that kind of says enough for me,” he said.
    

            World No.1 Jason Day was also still to tee off but likes his chances at a course he says “almost feels like home”, given his agent lives nearby.
    

            

    

            “This is one tournament that is very stressful and I feel like I thrive under stress, and hopefully I can do that this year,” said the Australian who won the U.S. PGA  last year for his maiden major title.
    

            The first round will resume on Saturday morning at Oakmont as organizers hope to get back on track to avoid a Monday finish.
    

            Ironically, the U.S. Open is the only major to retain an 18-hole Monday playoff, so further lengthy delays could extend play into Tuesday.

            Terror group al Qaeda is “resurgent” and looking to carry out attacks on passenger planes in Europe, UK Security Minister Ben Wallace has warned.
    

            In an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Times, Wallace said al Qaeda –  the group behind the infamous World Trade Center attacks that killed almost 3,000 people in the US on September 11, 2001 – “still aspire for aviation attacks” and is developing technology to bring down planes.
    

            “The aviation threat is real,” Wallace said in the interview on Saturday night. “(Al Qaeda) have reorganized. They are pushing more and more plots towards Europe and have become familiar with the new methods.”
    

      
      

      

    

            The rise of ISIS has overshadowed the al Qaeda threat in recent years – particularly after its most prominent leader, Osama Bin Laden, was killed by US forces in Pakistan in 2011.
    

            But Wallace said the danger had never truly diminished.
    

            “Al Qaeda sat quietly in the corner and tried to work out what the 21st century looked like while ISIS became the latest terrorist boy band,” he said. “But they have not gone away.”
    

            British intelligence chiefs are also concerned about US President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, with Wallace saying it will create a “new safe haven for Islamists to launch attacks on the West.”
    

            His remarks echo concerns voiced by US politicians, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, who told Trump in the past week that withdrawing troops from the Middle East 

    

            Wallace’s statements come amid widespread chaos at Gatwick Airport in the UK over the weekend as rogue drones flying overhead led dozens of flights to be canceled.

Manchester City beat Manchester United 2-1
City's Premier League lead is now 11 points

            England’s Football Association has asked Manchester United and Manchester City for their “observations” over a fracas involving players and coaches from both teams following Sunday’s key Premier League game.
    

            City coach Mikel Arteta was widely reportedly to have suffered a cut to the head in the melee that involved up to 20 players and members of staff of the two teams. 
    

            Britain’s Press Association reported United boss Jose Mourinho was embroiled in a “heated exchange” with City players after his side were beaten 2-1 by the Premier League leaders.
    

            United were unhappy about City’s whooping and cheering following a win that extended their league lead over second-place United to 11 points.
    

            Neither club has commented on the incident and have not responded to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            Greater Manchester Police told CNN it hadn’t been contacted by either club or any individual over the bust-up.
    
Amazing game. Such a big performance from everyone. We go again next week 
 
 

            

    

            Mourinho had water thrown at him and the Press Association reported that United’s manager was involved in a “confrontation” with City goalkeeper Ederson.
    

            Usually at Old Trafford one police officer is always positioned outside the referee’s dressing room, which is very close to the visiting team’s locker room.
    

            Both clubs were asked to respond by December 13, before the FA extended the deadline to December 15 by 6pm.
    

            David Silva gave City the lead before Marcus Rashford equalized just before halftime, but Nicolas Otamendi grabbed a second-half winner after capitalizing on Romelu Lukaku’s error. 
    

            Mourinho was particularly unhappy that referee Michael Oliver booked United midfielder Ander Herrera for diving after a challenge by Otamendi, rather than giving the home team a penalty.
    

            “It is a huge penalty in a crucial moment of the game,” Mourinho told reporters.
    

            City boss Pep Guardiola said: “We won because we were better, in all departments.”

            In September, Boston suspended Udoka for the entire 2022/23 season for violating team policies, following an investigation into his conduct by an independent law firm. According to ESPN, The Athletic and the Boston Globe, Udoka had a consensual relationship with a female member of the team’s staff.
    

      
      

      

    

            Udoka was let go by Boston in February after the Celtics removed the interim tag off current Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla. 
    

            “I released a statement months ago when everything happened and apologized to a lot of people for the tough position I put them in,” Udoka told reporters. “I stand by that, and I feel much more remorse even now.”
    

            The 45-year-old said he spent time working on himself by going to counseling with his son and taking sensitivity training.
    

            “Having that time off and really a full understanding of how many people you impact by a poor decision, that’s where you start with the ownership and accountability,” Udoka said. 
    

            “I preach that to the players and so I have to take responsibility for my part in it. (I) took leadership and sensitivity training and some counseling with my son to help him improve the situation that I put him in.”
    

            On whether the Celtics were justified in the actions they took against him, Udoka said: “They had a choice to make a decision and they went that route. My thing was own up to it, take responsibility and I served the suspension …  It was their right to go about it however they wanted to.”
    

            Rockets governor Tilman Fertitta said he felt comfortable hiring Udoka after speaking with the league.
    

            “The NBA told me that they felt very comfortable with Ime becoming the coach of the Houston Rockets and so that made me feel really good after a lengthy, lengthy conversation with them.”
    

            In his lone season (2021/22) at the helm in Boston, Udoka guided the Celtics to a 51-31 record and an NBA Finals appearance in which they lost to the Golden State Warriors. The season prior to his arrival, the Celtics finished 36-36.
    

            Udoka inherits a Rockets team that finished the year 22-60, tied for the worst record in the Western Conference with another Texas team, the San Antonio Spurs.

            Novak Djokovic says his “good” intentions were “misconstrued” after a 
he sent to Craig Tiley, the CEO of Tennis Australia, prompted a backlash from sections of the public.
    

            The Serb’s suggestions would have loosened the restrictions on the quarantining tennis players ahead of next month’s Australian Open and make their acclimation to playing on a court easier once the self-isolation periods are over.
    

            These included fitness and training equipment in every room, food that meets the standard of that served at the Australian Open, reducing the number of days the players are required to quarantine for, permission to visit coaches providing both have returned negative Covid-19 tests and moving as many players as possible to private houses with tennis courts.
    

            Currently, 72 players are in isolation after three separate charter flights into Melbourne last week each had passengers that tested positive for Covid-19, meaning everyone on board the three aircraft had to isolate on arrival.
    

            Djokovic’s requests were flatly denied by the Victoria Premier, Daniel Andrews.
    

            “My good intentions to my fellow competitors in Melbourne have been misconstrued as being selfish, difficult and ungrateful,” the eight-time Australian Open champion said in a statement on Twitter. “This couldn’t be father from the truth. 
    

            “I genuinely care about my fellow players and I also understand very well how the world is run and who gets bigger and better and why. I’ve earned my privileges the hard way and for that reason, it is very difficult for me to be a mere onlooker knowing how much every help, gesture and good word mattered to me when I was small and insignificant in the world pecking order. 
    

            “Hence, I use my position of privilege to be of service as much as I can where and when needed. “There were a few suggestions and ideas that I gathered from other players from our chat group and there was no harm intended to try and help.”
    

            As she adjusts to life quarantining ahead of the Australian Open, tennis star 
 has revealed she is mourning the death of her grandfather, less than a week after announcing that her grandmother and aunt had passed away due to Covid-19.
    

            The 
 is currently undergoing a strict 14-day quarantine at a Melbourne hotel ahead of next month’s grand slam.
    

            In a social media post last week, Stephens revealed her Auntie Anna had passed away on December 26 and her grandmother on January 10.
    

            “I’ve watched this video from NY about 100 times today,” she wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, accompanied by a clip of her speaking to her grandfather over the phone following her US Open triumph. “My grandpa has gone to be with the Lord and the love of his life. One week apart from my grandma. Losing her was too much for his heart.
    

            “My grandpa was the kindest soul and I will miss him forever. I can only hope to fill so many lives with the love and happiness he did. He is the definition of love, kindness, generosity and a true example of family.
    

            “All I ever wanted to do was to make my grandparents proud! I’m most proud they got to witness my tennis dreams come true & become a reality. I’m thankful for the time I had with both of them & grateful that I can see so much of them both in my mother, who continues to be my rock. Stories will be told of their great love. May they rest together in eternal peace.”
    

            Stephens is one of 72 players set to compete at the Australian Open currently undergoing a strict hotel quarantine period.
    

            On Wednesday, Victoria’s Police Minister, Lisa Neville, announced that a further three people – two of which are players – set to attend the Australian Open had tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total number to 10.
    

            Neville said authorities were “very confident” one of the two new player infections was a case of viral shedding. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “One of those is a player who we absolutely believe is shedding, but has anyway been in hard lockdown because he came in on one of the flights where we had positives,” Neville said. “One is another player. One is a support person with that player.
    

            “In the meantime, the player, the support person and their bubble so the other support person and player they’re with will not be training until we have a final confirmation that they are shedding or that they are positive. If they are positive, those two will go onto a health hotel and the two bubble people will be considered close contacts and will be in lockdown for the 14 days.”
    

            Viral shedding is the release of the virus from the body into the environment and can occur even if a person has tested negative for Covid-19.
    

            Players currently stuck in quarantine have been getting creative with ways to practice while confined to their hotel rooms, with some resorting to using their beds as makeshift hitting partners.
    

            However, normally accustomed to practicing on a court for several hours a day in the lead up to a grand slam, some players have suggested those who underwent quarantine will be at a physical disadvantage when the Australian Open starts on February 8.
    

            Daniel Vallverdu, coach of three-time grand slam winner Stan Wawrinka, has proposed that the players who were stuck in their hotel rooms should receive preferential treatment when the tournament begins, including more practice time and matches at cooler times of the day.

            One of Scotland’s oldest fox hunts has come to an end after 252 years following the introduction of new law on hunting.
    

            The Hunting with Dogs bill, which went into effect earlier this week after being passed in January, outlaws hunting and killing wild mammals using packs of dogs except in limited circumstances.
    

            Following its introduction, the Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire Hunt – which first met in the 1700s – announced it had held its final meet.
    

            “We were humbled to see the huge support by riders and supporters for our modest hunt in the west of Scotland,” the group wrote on Facebook, also thanking “all farmers and landowners who have allowed us to cross your land in some tricky weather over the years.” 
    

            “A big thank you to every single person who has helped out in any way over the years, big or small, it is all very much appreciated,” it said. 
    

            “Finally we wish to thank our lovely hounds, we look after them with great love and affection, often better than we do ourselves.” 
    

            Originating in the sixteenth century, fox hunting remains a controversial topic in the United Kingdom. 
    

            Hunters view it as an important part of local heritage while animal rights activists argue that it is cruel and unnecessary. 
    

            Anti-hunting organizations have previously welcomed the bill’s implementation. 
    

            “This historic news is a huge win for wildlife, locals against the hunt and of course hunt saboteurs who have spent decades bringing this hunt to their knees,” the Glasgow Hunt Sabs said on its website.

            Jorge Lorenza kickstarted his MotoGP title defense on Sunday as he won the Italian Grand Prix for the third year in a row.

            “In general, this was a difficult weekend. The back tire was giving me a lot of problems with grip but taking 20 points from this race and maintaining the lead the World Championship is something positive.”
    

            Marquez had been aiming to become the first newcomer to finish on the podium in the first five races of a season, but he suffered his seventh crash since stepping up to motorcycling’s elite division.
    

            

    

            “After three difficult days of setbacks and hard work, I finally felt good during the race,” said the 20-year-old, who dropped 26 points behind Pedrosa.
    

            “I don’t fully understand why I crashed, as I lost both the front and the back at the same time and was unable to save it. It’s clear that we made a mistake, but we can’t go looking for excuses.
    

            “We can’t forget that this is my first year in the class and I am here to learn how things are in MotoGP. In spite of everything we were still fighting for second place, which is a reason to be happy.”
    

            Lorenzo’s Yamaha teammate Valentino Rossi was another casualty, with Italy’s seven-time world champion retiring only three corners into the race after being hit by Alvaro Bautista.
    

            Rossi’s previous team Ducati gave the home fans something to cheer as Andrea Dovizioso, Nicky Hayden and Michele Pirro were fifth, sixth and seventh respectively.

            When 
steps out onto the pitch for Saturday’s Copa America final, it could be his last chance to win a trophy with Argentina.
    

            Standing in his way, as he attempts to end his country’s 28-year trophy drought, will be a familiar face in former Barcelona teammate Neymar.
    

            Brazil is the current defending champion and boasts the formidable record of having won every previous edition played on home soil – this year’s tournament was also moved to Brazil just 13 days before kick-off after co-hosts Colombia and Argentina were stripped of hosting rights.
    

            Few would expect an underwhelming Argentina side to go far at next year’s World Cup in Qatar and Messi will be 37 the next time the Copa America comes around in 2024.
    

            Widely considered one of the greatest players of all time, 
 relationship with the Argentine national team and its fans has been fraught at times.
    

            In the past, after some fairly lackluster performances, he has been accused by some of caring more about Barcelona than Argentina, something Messi has always strongly denied.
    

            

    

            Over the years, however, he has gone on to become a revered figure in his homeland.
    

    

            That was never more obvious than when Messi announced his retirement following defeat in the 2016 Copa America final – the second year in a row Argentina had lost to Chile on penalties – and the entire country united in a successful attempt to convince him to pull on the blue and white shirt again.
    

            At times, Messi has single-handedly carried the national team over the years, notably during qualification process to the 2018 World Cup, during which Argentina flirted with the possibility of failing to reach the finals.
    

            During the semifinal penalty shootout win over Colombia, Messi – who has four goals and five assists in this Copa America – once again showed the type of leader he has become for Argentina.
    

            National broadcaster TyC Sport featured a ‘Messi-Cam’ during the shootout, which was focused on the Argentine captain the entire time. It showed his intense reaction to each penalty Argentina scored, while he was also the first to console Rodrigo De Paul after his miss.
    

            

    

            However, it was his reaction to Yerry Mina’s miss that generated the biggest reaction on social media. 
    

            The Colombia defender has become known for his somewhat over the top celebrations after scoring in shootouts and after his penalty was saved by Emiliano Martinez, Messi could be seen shouting “dance now” at Mina during his entire walk back to the center circle.
    

            Messi exuberance was a stark contrast to the last time he featured in a penalty shootout for Argentina. After missing his penalty in the final against Chile in 2016, Messi was doubled over on the turf and appeared to be close to vomiting.
    

            Martinez was unquestionably the hero of Wednesday’s tie, saving three of Colombia’s penalties and the Aston Villa goalkeeper was mobbed by Messi and his teammates.
    

            Saturday’s showpiece will be the first time since 2007 that Brazil and Argentina have faced off in a Copa America final, incidentally Messi’s first with the national team.
    

            There will be 5,500 spectators at the iconic Maracana stadium to watch it, the first time fans will be able to attend matches this tournament. 
    

            The attendees will have to show a negative Covid-19 PCR test, wear masks, and maintain two meters distance from while inside.
    

            Brazil will be hoping for a repeat of that comfortable 3-0 win and go into this match as the favorite.
    

            Under head coach Tite, Brazil is a long way from playing the ‘beautiful football’ of old, but this side is pragmatic and dogged, a style that has brought considerable success over the past five years.
    

            That culminated in victory at the 2019 Copa America, the country’s first piece of major silverware since 2007.
    

            Brazil has never quite clicked into top gear during this tournament, but has found success built on a stingy defense; the team has conceded just two goals all tournament and none so far in the knockout stages.
    

            Even when down to 10 men for the entire second half in the quarterfinal against Chile, Brazil never looked like conceding a goal.
    

            Neymar’s legacy with the Brazilian national team is already guaranteed to be one of glory. Not only has he led the team to Olympic and Copa America glory on home soil, he will more than likely finish his career’s as Brazil’s greatest ever goalscorer, currently just nine goals behind Pele.
    

            Should Messi lead Argentina to glory, however, it would certainly alter his legacy entirely.

British police reopened their investigation into her disappearance in July 2013

            British police investigating the 2007 disappearance of Madeleine McCann will begin digging this week in an area of wasteland close to where she went missing in Portugal, sources close to the investigation have told CNN.
    

            Media have gathered outside a cordoned-off area of the beach resort town of Praia da Luz, in Portugal’s Algarve region, but it is unclear when digging will begin.
    

            Madeleine was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family’s holiday apartment on May 3, 2007.
    

            Her parents had left Madeleine and her younger twin siblings asleep while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Her mother raised the alarm when she checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            CNN understands that London’s Metropolitan Police will be in charge of the new digging operation in abandoned terrain close to where Madeleine disappeared. A large investigation team is expected to use dogs and radar in the search and dig a number of holes, sources said.
    

            Portuguese police searched the area soon after Madeleine’s disappearance, and it is understood they will intervene only if a body is found.
    

            Sources told CNN that British police were working on the assumption that Madeleine was dead, while their Portuguese counterparts were working on the assumption that she was still alive and had been taken out of Portugal by a non-Portuguese national who had been in the country for a short time.
    

            Scotland Yard – as London’s Metropolitan Police are known – has not commented on the latest development, other than to confirm that British officers would be in Praia da Luz this week.

            “It should not be assumed that this substantial upcoming phase of work in Portugal will immediately lead us to the answers that will explain what has happened,” he warned. “What you will see is normal police activity you would expect in any such major investigation.”
    

            Rowley said the senior investigator in the case, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, and his team would be traveling to Portugal but would not be commenting on the investigation.
    

            He reiterated that Portuguese police had advised Metropolitan Police that they did not brief media on current investigations.
    

            “They clearly stated that if the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) provide any briefings or information on the work they are undertaking on our behalf, or if reporters cause any disruption to their work in Portugal, activity will cease until that problem dissipates,” Rowley said.
    

            “We have made it clear to colleagues in Portugal that we will not be giving operational updates,” he said. “If media interfere with police work, that work will stop.”

Premier League side beat off competition from third-tier team Leyton Orient
Reconstruction work on the arena expected to cost between $210-240 million
U.S. president's favorite English team will contribute $24 million

            Barack Obama received the backing of a nation when he was elected for a second term as U.S. president last month, and now his favorite English soccer club has also won a significant ballot.
    

            English Premier League side West Ham United – the team of choice of the 44th president of the United States – has been selected as the preferred occupant for London’s Olympic Stadium, the venue which hosted the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.
    

            The London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) announced on Wednesday that the east London club – whose stadium is located near to the former Olympic Park site in Stratford – had beaten off competition from neighboring third-tier team Leyton Orient, a proposed sports university project and a consortium looking to bring Formula One to the British capital.
    

            

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “The LLDC’s board unanimously agreed that West Ham United’s bid for a concession to play at the Olympic Stadium should be ranked highest of the bids received, and that negotiations should be held with the club on final commercial terms for them to move to the stadium,” read a statement on the organization’s website.
    

            West Ham had initially tried to buy the stadium and was named the preferred bidder in February 2011, but that deal collapsed in October of that year after threats of court action from rival candidates and an independent review of the process.
    

            The stadium was then offered to potential tenants, and from an initial 16 interested parties the list was cut to four bidders in March 2012.
    

            Despite backing West Ham’s bid for the 80,000-seater arena, the LLDC insisted any future tenant would have to accommodate the 2017 World Athletics Championships.
    

            If West Ham cannot cater for track and field, the club would be unable to complete its proposed move to the site.
    

            “If a football use can be agreed the stadium would be reconfigured to provide a retractable/moveable seating solution so there could be a quick change over between athletics and football use,” the LLDC said.
    

            “The legacy corporation recognizes that West Ham and other parties may not be able to meet the necessary conditions, so is progressing a detailed design for a non-football option.  This would allow the stadium to be brought back into use as soon as possible.”
    

            West Ham’s joint chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold hailed Wednesday’s announcement as the latest step in realizing the vision they had for the club when they purchased a 50% shareholding for $85 million in 2010.
    

            “We are ambitious for our great club and aim to set the benchmark for visiting away and neutral football supporters from across the globe to come and enjoy the iconic Stadium and be part of our Premier League club experience,” they said in a statement.
    

            Reconstruction work on the stadium, including extending the roof and adding retractable seating, will reportedly cost between $210-240 million and will be funded by a mix of public money and a $64 million loan from the local Newham Council.
    

            West Ham is expected to contribute $24 million to the restructuring of the public-funded stadium, which cost $690 million to build.
    

            The club returned to the English top flight in August following relegation in 2011, and has made an encouraging start to the season under the guidance of manager Sam Allardyce, sitting eighth in the table with 22 points from 15 matches.
    

            Obama has reportedly been a fan of “the Hammers” since a trip to England several years before his election to office in 2008.
    

            The club’s supporters have even sung songs in his honor during matches,

2015-12-24 21:10:00+00:00,,"British weather service tells parents and kids to look to the sky on Christmas Eve
The International Space Station overflew the UK early Thursday evening, making like Santa
Britons take to social media: ""magic is unreal"" ... ""my daughter waving"" 

            Good boys and girls – and their kids – watched Santa’s sleigh (better known to grownups as the International Space Station) fly over the United Kingdom on Christmas Eve, thanks in part to a timely tip from the nation’s weather service.
    

            “As excited children everywhere wait with anticipation for Father Christmas, why not take a look up into the night sky on Christmas Eve and see if you can spot him, (or rather, the ISS),” the Met Office wrote in a statement on their website days before Thursday’s much-anticipated appearance. 
    

            The weather service said earlier this week that children looking up at the sky would be thrilled to see the bright light of the space station as St. Nick himself speeding past on his journey around the world.
    

            Indeed, they kept their Christmas promise.
    

            Eager parents took to social media to share the joy of this Christmas miracle, (or, prescheduled orbit, for the Grinches among us) at around 5:30 p.m. (12:30 p.m. ET).
    

            “Took caleb outside to see santa crossin the sky (aka space station) the magic is unreal! @NASA thanks for letting me know #magic #nasa #love,” one Mom wrote on Twitter.
    

            NASA had also posted times and coordinates where Christmas revelers could 
 in London, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow and other cities. The timely flyover was more visible in the south of the country where forecasters predicted clear weather conditions. 
    

            “@spacegovuk @esa @Space_Station a brief viewing tonight. My daughter waving at the ISS shouting “Santa” Merry Christmas to the ISS crew.”
    

            One dad tweeted one small problem to astronaut Tim Peake, one of six crew members currently aboard the station:
    

            “@mattyjc @astro_timpeake problem with my kids. They’re both space station fans. 
    

            Dad: “That’s Santa”
    

            Kids: “Don’t be silly, that’s Tim in ISS.” 
    

            The International Space Station was built in collaboration by 16 countries and has been continuously crewed since 2000, when the first NASA astronauts arrived on an expedition. 
    

            It weighs nearly 1 million pounds and is about the size of a football field. It has as much pressurized living and working space as a Boeing 747 passenger jet. The station circles the Earth every 90 minutes, giving those on board a spectacular sunrise or sunset every 45 minutes.
    

            Three of the current crew members posted a holiday message on YouTube earlier this month.
    

            “Christmas is generally a time for friends and families to get together, and although we can’t be with our families this year, we will be orbiting the Earth 16 times on Christmas Day and sending all our good wishes to everybody back down on beautiful planet Earth,” 

    

            The three astronauts then rolled into a synchronized somersault – Christmas cheer delivered from zero gravity.

            Edwards and Usman will go head to head at London’s 02 Arena on Saturday, which has the second-highest seating capacity of any indoor venue in the United Kingdom.
    

            The early prelims were slated to start at 12:30 pm EDT, followed by the prelims at 3:00 pm and the main card at 5:00 pm. 
    

            The primary draw for the tournament is the main card battle between Edwards, the current UFC Welterweight Champion, and Usman, the former champion. Usman won a 2015 match against Edwards in his official debut as a UFC athlete, but lost to Edwards during a 2022 rematch. 
    

            But there are other exciting matches on the main card, including Rafael Fiziev vs. Justin Gaethje, Bryan Barberena vs. Gunnar Nelson, Casey O’Neill vs. Jennifer Maia, and Roman Dolidze vs. Marvin Vettori.

lifted the 
 on Thursday, after beating 
 2-1 in front of more than 15,000 fans. 
    

            The game, held in Budapest’s Puskas Arena, was the first major UEFA final to be held in front of spectators since the pandemic forced fixtures behind closed doors. 
    

            European football’s governing body treated the event as a pilot to bring fans back to stadiums, with both teams being allocated 3,000 tickets with the remainder taken up by locals. 
    

            Those in attendance watched an intriguing encounter between last season’s Champions League and Europa League winners, with the Bundesliga club coming out on top. 
    

            “We all know it is not easy to take the right decision,” Bayern manager Hansi Flick told reporters when asked about the presence of fans. 
    

            “It felt good to have an atmosphere in the stadium. It felt a bit more like football. I hope all the fans return home healthy.”
    

            

    

            Bayern needed extra-time to get the job done with Javi Martinez heading a 104th-minute winner in what could be his last game for the club. 
    

            Working tirelessly against the most in-form team in Europe, Sevilla had initially taken the lead after Lucas Ocampos’ audacious ‘no-look’ penalty before Leon Goretzka leveled the scores in the second half. 
    

            The hard-fought win secured an impressive quadruple for Bayern in 2020, adding to the three trophies it won last season – the Bundesliga, the German Cup and the Champions League. 
    

            Bayern is now unbeaten in 32 consecutive matches and has become the first team in Europe’s top five leagues to win 23 consecutive matches in all competitions. 
    

            It won its last league match 8-0 against Schalke. 
    

            “It was an intense game but we deserved to win,” Flick told reporters after the Super Cup victory. 
    

            “We are not yet fully in our rhythm despite our big win (8-0) over Schalke 04 on the weekend.
    

            “But the mentality of the team, especially after going 1-0 down, was sensational. They battled back against very strong opponents and deserved the win.”
    

            

    

            The sight of fans watching live football will be a welcome return for many but there had been much criticism over the decision to allow thousands to attend. 
    

            Europe is currently facing a second wave of Covid-19 infections, stoking fears the game could cause a further rise in cases.
    

      
      

      

    

            According to the World Health Organization, there have been 20,450 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Hungary and 702 deaths, but like much of Europe, the country faces a second wave of cases with more than 6,000 infections recorded last week.
    

            Those in attendance on Thursday had to abide by social distancing measures, such as remaining one-and-a-half meters apart, wearing face masks and undergoing a body temperature check on entry.
    

            “The measures are strict and there is not a question of health risks for the fans,” UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said in a press conference before the game.
    

            “We want – and health is the number one priority – to bring hope, to do what we think is the proper thing to do.
    

            “Don’t think we are doing this because of money because we don’t get any revenue, we get more costs with it. But fans and players are [an] essential part of football.”

            Serbia has never won the Fed Cup and so the opportunity of being the first women from the country to land the honour is a huge lure for the team.
    

            “It’s an historical moment for Serbian women’s tennis,” Jankovic told the tournament’s official website.
    

            “We are all excited to be here in Prague and to have this opportunity to win the title, which is our ultimate goal and we very much look forward to the competition.
    

            “Winning Fed Cup would be a very special feeling. It’s difficult to compare it to your individual tournaments when you are lifting trophies because you are basically there on your own and here you can celebrate with your team.
    

            “For me, personally, the inspiration is the Serbian people and I always feel an obligation to give more than 100 per cent. Winning the title would be an amazing achievement.”
    

            

    

            A sell-out crowd of 13,800 is expected after tickets for the final sold out in less than six hours with Petra Kvitova’s father, Jiri, buying 100 for his friends and family.
    

            Kvitova is set to overcome the bout of bronchitis which forced her to withdraw from last week’s WTA Championships.
    

            The 22-year-old, who is ranked eighth in the world, will lead the Czech charge and insists the pressure of playing in front of an expectant home crowd won’t affect the players.
    

            “I don’t think that we have a pressure because we are the defending champions,” she told the competition’s official website.
    

             “I think it’s because we are playing at home, it’s a full stadium and 14,000 people will come to support us. I’m looking forward to the tie for every minute.”
    

            Meanwhile in France, home favorite Gilles Simon booked his place in the semifinals of the Paris Masters.
    

            Simon defeated fifth seed 6-4 6-4, who is aiming to reach is second Masters 1000 final, will now face Polish qualifier Jerzy Janowicz.
    

            Janowicz, who defeated Andy Murray on Thursday, saw off Janko Tipsarevic, who was forced to retire through illness with the Pole leading 3-6, 6-1, 4-.1
    

            “In the second and third set I just played the best tennis of my life,” Janowicz told the ATP website.
    

            

    

             “I didn’t know actually I can play that good. It’s really not easy for me to realise what is going on in my life right now. 
    

            “Right now I’m playing the best tennis of my life, and I hope tomorrow I can play even better. 
    

            “I don’t know what I should expect from myself, but I hope I will not finish tomorrow this tournament yet.”
    

            David Ferrer is the highest surviving seed remaining in the competition after he defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-2 7-5.
    

            The Spaniard, seeded fourth, will now play home favourite Michael Llodra for a place in the final.
    

            Llodra saw off America’s Sam Querrey 7-6 6-3 and will now hope to beat Ferrer for the first time having lost his previous two contests against the World No. 5.

            Vice President Mike Pence sat in close proximity to Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, at the opening ceremony of the PyeongChang Games on Friday.
    

            Pence, who has been vocal in his criticism of North Korea in the run-up to the Games, sat just feet away. Asked by CNN if there was any concern by Pence about Kim’s sister sitting behind him, an aide to the vice president said, “not in the slightest.” 
    

      
      

      

    

            “He participated in a trilateral with (South Korean President Moon Jae-in) and (Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe) prior in a show of solidarity and then was thrilled to cheer on Team USA at the opening ceremony.”
    

            The aide noted that Pence “and our team were aware she’d be in attendance. A primary purpose of the trip was to show a united front with our allies in Japan and South Korea in support of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. The VP sat with Moon and Abe in the box after days of meetings with both leaders.”
    

            Kim Yo Jong is the first member of the North’s ruling dynasty to visit the south since the end of the Korean War in 1953. 
    

      
      

      

    

            The presence of Kim, who was promoted to the country’s Politburo, the senior body of North Korea’s communist party, as an alternate member last year, represents a hugely significant move in the thawing of relations between the North and South. Such a high-level meeting would have been unimaginable even a few months ago, but Moon sees the Winter Olympics as a chance to make diplomatic inroads with the North.

            British Black Lives Matter activist Sasha Johnson is in critical condition after being shot in the head in London, according to her political party.
    

            “It is with great sadness that we inform you that our own Sasha Johnson has been brutally attacked and sustained a gunshot wound to her head,” the Taking the Initiative Party (TTIP) said in a Sunday 
. “She is currently in intensive care and in a critical condition.”
    

            The party said the attack happened “following numerous death threats as a result of her activism.”  
    

            London’s Metropolitan Police responded to reports of gunfire in southeast London about 3 a.m. local time Sunday morning, it said in a statement. 
    

            Police said paramedics transported a 27-year-old woman with gunshot wounds to a south London hospital, and that the incident appeared to have happened near a house party in Southwark.
    

            The police statement said that at this early stage of investigation there was no evidence to suggest a targeted attack or that the woman “had received any credible threats against her prior to this incident.”
    

            Detectives from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command (Trident) are conducting an investigation and looking to speak with anyone who was at the party in the Consort Road area of London, it added.
    

            “A dedicated team of detectives is working tirelessly to identify the person or persons responsible for this shooting,” said Detective Chief Inspector Jim Tele. He added that “they need the public’s help,” and urged people to come forward if they witnessed or had heard information about the incident.
    

            Tele added that while he recognized the incident “will have shocked those in the local community and further afield” he called on the public to “avoid speculating as to the motive or the circumstances behind it.” 
    

      
      

      

    

            Johnson rose to prominence last year during the Black Lives Matter protests, as a leader of the TTIP, which has been called “Britain’s first Black-led political party.”   
    

            She is a mother of three, and also works to deliver food and groceries to families in need, according to the party, which called her “a strong, powerful voice for our people and our community” in its Sunday statement.
    

            At a vigil hosted by Black Lives Matter UK on Monday evening outside Kings’ College Hospital in south London, supporters and fellow activists huddled under a bandstand and joined in lively chants of support and prayer, accompanied by drumming and movement.
    

            “Every time she grabbed the mic, she spoke the truth,” one supporter told the vigil. “We need to make enough noise so she can wake up,” the supporter added, met with cheers from the crowd.
    

            Leo Muhammad, told CNN that Johnson is a “warrior, a young sister who has been thrust to the forefront of the struggle for justice in the UK.”
    

            Muhammad, a friend of Johnson, said that although the facts of the shooting were still being established, “whether it was targeted or [whether] she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, the fact is, nobody is spraying bullets into white communities, but it’s a regular occurrence within the black community. We should be very concerned about that kind of activity.”
    

            Campaigner Caul Grant told CNN that he was “absolutely devastated” to hear about what happened to Johnson, saying that although he has only known Johnson for about a year, she has had a “huge impact” on his life as a young person in the community. 
    

            “No justice, no peace,” the crowd chanted.
    

            Earlier Monday, Black Lives Matter UK hailed Johnson as a “young mother and fearless political campaigner who was at the forefront of many BLM protests last summer,” in a message on Twitter.
    

            Several British lawmakers 
 paid tribute to the dedicated activist in the wake of the shooting.
    

            “Whoever carried out this dreadful shooting of Sasha Johnson needs to be caught quickly. Give any info you have to @MPSSouthwark. Reported death threats will need to be investigated,” wrote Harriet Harman, a Labour Member of Parliament for Camberwell and Peckham, who also wished Johnson a “full recovery.”
    

            Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, tweeted: “Nobody should have to potentially pay with their life because they stood up for racial justice.” 
    

            David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, described the news as “gut-wrenching” and said he was “Praying for Sasha Johnson, her family and friends that she makes a quick and full recovery.”
    

            Claudia Webbe, an MP for Leicester East, shared her “love and solidarity” with Johnson’s family and friends following the incident. 
    

            Webbe said news of the shooting was “shocking” and that “all women should be safe on our streets” in a tweet. 
    

            “When I think of the brutal shooting of Sasha Johnson it reminds me that the culture of gun violence is all-consuming affecting whole communities & neighbourhoods. The bullet does not discriminate in its effect. But too many women become collateral damage in this ‘culture of fear,’” Webbe said in a separate tweet.

            A 15-year-old girl with a learning disability has gone missing while on holiday in 
, in what police are treating as a possible abduction.
    

            Nora Quoirin, from London, was staying at a resort in a nature reserve 39 miles south of the capital, Kuala Lumpur.
    

            Her father discovered she was missing from her room at 8 a.m. local time on Sunday, and noticed that her window was open, according to the Lucie Blackman Trust (LBT) charity, which is assisting the family.
    

      
      

      

    

            Malaysian police have told the family the incident is being treated as both an abduction and a missing person case, the group told CNN.
    

            Quoirin, who has an Irish mother and a French father, was traveling on an Irish passport during the trip. The Dusun resort, where the family were staying, is in a remote area 800 feet above sea level, in the Titiwangsa mountain range.
    

            “This is a very vulnerable young girl missing in a remote location. She has been missing for over 24 hours now and it is imperative that every resource available is deployed to search for her,” LBT’s chief executive, Matthew Searle, said in a statement.
    

            “It is possible she has been seen or taken in by somebody and is unable to communicate, so we urge everyone who can to share our appeal poster and social media appeals,” he added. “Sadly it is also possible that Nora has been the victim of serious crime – we urge anyone with any information to come forward.”
    

            In a statement posted online, the management of the Dusun resort said that hotel staff searched the 12 acre (48,562 square meter) property “all Sunday morning,” before then joining the wider police search of the surrounding area. 
    

            Aisling Agnew, the girl’s aunt, was quoted by LBT as saying: “Nora’s parents and relatives in Ireland and France are distraught by her disappearance. Nora is a child with special needs and has learning and developmental disabilities which make her especially vulnerable and we fear for her safety.”
    

            “Nora would not know how to get help and would never leave her family voluntarily. We now consider this a criminal matter. We are appealing to everyone to assist the local police in any way they can and to pass on any information that would help locate our beloved Nora without delay.”
    

            The family have set up an email address for information – findnoraq@gmail.com – and the LBT has encouraged anyone with information about her disappearance to call +44 8000 988 485.

Constitutional role of British monarchs is to steer clear of politics
Queen Elizabeth II has political views but never makes them known in public

            The storm over Queen Elizabeth II’s reported views on the European Union and whether Britain should vote in a referendum to leave the EU cuts to the very heart of royal neutrality.
    

            

    

            The Sun newspaper published a front-page article Wednesday with the headline “Queen backs Brexit,” a term used to describe a potential “British exit” from the EU.
    

            In a dismissive statement about the report, Buckingham Palace said: “The Queen remains politically neutral as she has for 63 years. … The referendum is a matter for the British people to decide.”
    

            Ever since her ancestor King Charles I lost his head in 1649 following the English Civil War with Parliament, British monarchs’ constitutional role has gradually distilled to this: representing the whole country – and steering clear of politics.
    

            The 
underlined this reality when it became clear that Parliament would not even allow Edward VIII to marry Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee he loved, and remain king. 
    

      
      

      

    

            So the reason for Buckingham Palace’s frustration is simple: The royal family’s position requires the support of parliamentarians – on either side of the political divide. To support one party – or cause – will only lead to trouble further down the line.
    

            

    

            Of course, this is not to say that the Queen has no political views. Several of her prime ministers have recalled the 
she has given in the meetings she holds with them every week – but those words have always remained private.
    

            And while the royal family realizes it can only survive by appearing to be above the political fray – it is far from being politically naive. In 1917, near the end of World War I, the family changed its name from 
 to the more English-sounding Windsor amid widespread anti-German feeling.
    

            On rare occasions her thoughts have made it into the public domain. BBC correspondent Frank Gardner revealed in 2012 that the Queen told him she was surprised that radical Islamic cleric Abu Hamza was still free. 
 for disclosing the monarch’s remarks. 
    

            And during the Scottish referendum campaign, Elizabeth told a well-wisher outside a church that she hoped people would “
.” It was a rare moment of candor for someone well aware that anything she says in public has the potential to be picked up by reporters. 
    

            The situation is slightly different with other members of the royal family. Her heir, Prince Charles, is an outspoken supporter of environmental causes and 
expressing his views. Her husband, Prince Philip, is also famed for his forthright observations and jokes.
    

            

    

            Royal aides say Prince Charles will cease to express his opinions when he becomes king. Gradually he is being prepared for his future role: With a mother who has prided herself on never putting a foot wrong in public, Charles will realize the truth of the adage that silence is golden.

Finn will race until end of 2018 season

            Ferrari has extended the contract of Kimi Raikkonen until the end of next season, ending speculation the Finnish driver could be replaced.

            It will be Raikkonen’s fifth consecutive campaign with Ferrari, making him the Italian team’s second longest serving driver of all time.
    

            

    

            As it stands, only Michael Schumacher (179) and Felipe Massa (139) have made more grand prix starts than his total of 122. 
    

            Raikkonen previously raced for the Scuderia between 2007 and 2009, winning the driver’s world championship in his first year.

            Federer was hoping to match world number one Novak Djokovic,  who began his 2016 campaign with a “perfect” performance to claim the Doha title 24 hours earlier, but came up well short.
    

            The 34-year-old Swiss maestro had started the week with a flu bug, improving each round until he came up against fourth seed Raonic in the final on the Pat Rafter Arena, losing 6-4 6-4.

            Federer struggled with his first service throughout, facing and saving two break points in the fifth game before Raonic made the breakthrough on his second opportunity in the ninth.
    

            He served it out to take the opener in 41 minutes and the same pattern continued in the second set.
    

            Federer managed just one break point as Raonic served four double faults in the fourth game after having a medical time out for a right leg injury.
    

            The 17-time grand slam champion could not take advantage of the fleeting chance and was broken himself in the seventh game.
    

            Raonic claimed the title when Federer hit a backhand long, an immediate boost to his fortunes after a disappointing 2015 campaign, which saw him suffer with foot and back injuries. 
    

            It was his eight career crown and revenge for a three-set defeat to Federer in last year’s final in Brisbane.
    

            In an added twist, Raonic’s former coach Ivan Ljubicic has taken over the same duties with Federer, the Croat watching his defeat from a courtside box. 
    

            Raonic has paired up with former world number one Carlos Moya, who will be part of his team for the opening grand slam of the season in Melbourne.

            Nadal detained his arch-rival on court for just 73 minutes and has slipped behind in their head to head battle for the first time, Djokovic with 24 wins from 47 matches.
    

            It was the Serbian’s 60th career title and after not dropping a set all week acknowledged that he could not be in finer fettle.

            “I’m playing the tennis of my life, and I will try to nurture and cherish those moments on the court.,” he added.
    

            A dejected Nadal could only force one break point and was on the receiving end of 30 winners.
    

            “I played against a player who did everything perfect. I know nobody playing tennis like this ever. Since I know this sport I never saw somebody playing at this level,” was his verdict.

            Wawrinka, the only man to beat Djokovic in a grand slam last year, upsetting him in the final of the French Open, did not drop a set all week, but was extended by the promising Coric, who was playing his first ATP Tour final.

            Gregg Popovich has never shied away from speaking his mind.
    

            So its no surprise that the legendary coach of the San Antonio Spurs, a winner of five NBA titles, had a strong response when asked why it’s important for the league to celebrate Black History Month.
    

            “I think it’s pretty obvious. Our league is made up of a lot of black guys,” Popovich told reporters Monday before the Spurs took on the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City. “To honor that and understand it is pretty simplistic. How would you ignore that? More importantly, we live in a racist country that hasn’t figured it out yet. 
    

            “It’s always important to bring attention to it, even if it angers some people. The point is, you have to keep it in front of everybody’s nose and understand that it still hasn’t been taken care of and we still have a lot of work to do.” 
    

            It’s not the first time Popovich has been outspoken about race or politics, especially about 
:
    

            “This man in the Oval Office is a soulless coward who thinks that he can only become large by belittling others. This has of course been a common practice of his, but to do it in this manner – and to lie about how previous presidents responded to the deaths of soldiers – is as low as it gets.” – in a call to 
, after President Trump falsely claimed his predecessors 
 during their tenures.
    

            “I feel like there’s a cloud, a pall over the whole country in a paranoid, surreal sort of way. It’s got nothing to do with the Democrats losing the election, it has to do with the way one individual conducts himself, and that’s embarrassing. It’s dangerous to our institutions and what we all stand for and what we expect the country to be.” – before the Spurs 
 in the Western Conference Finals.
    

            “It’s still early and I’m still sick to my stomach. Not basically because the Republicans won or anything, but the disgusting tenor and tone and all the comments that have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, and I live in that country where half the country ignored all that to elect someone. That’s the scariest part of the whole thing to me.” –

            Barely 48 hours have passed since 
 when he reached an agreement with the European Union on 
 
    

            For a short period, the Prime Minister was walking on water in the eyes of his supporters. The surprise deal seemed to cause a groundswell of support and goodwill. So much so, that some of us in the House of Commons watching everything play out on what was supposed to be a 
 for British politics 
 to get his withdrawal deal approved by Parliament. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Then a bad thing happened. Oliver Letwin, a former Conservative Minister, tabled an amendment to Johnson’s motion that knocked the Prime Minister clean off his feet. 
    

            The Letwin amendment forced Johnson to send a letter to Brussels requesting an extension to the Brexit deadline. That’s because it withheld formal approval for Johnson’s deal until all the necessary legislation has passed. That could take days, if not weeks and certainly was not possible by 11 p.m. local time (6 p.m. ET) Saturday. 
    

            Johnson’s tone has been different of late. Gone is the flamboyant language, such as rather being “dead in a ditch” than request an extension or calling the Benn Act a “surrender bill”. Instead, he’s been talking about his love of Europe and his desire to reach across both the political divide and the nation in order to get a deal that works for the whole country. 
    

            In Brussels earlier this week, journalists were stunned at how well-received Johnson was by his EU counterparts. They congratulated him on striking this deal and applauded the manner in which he negotiated, which if you think back just a few months is nothing short of extraordinary. And he’d even got the entire Cabinet on message in regard to the Benn Act, saying that the government would “comply with the law.”
    

            But from the moment the Letwin amendment passed, we got a flash of the old Johnson. 
    

            He expressed his disappointment at the result and said that those MPs who’d backed Letwin had scuppered the “opportunity to have a meaningful vote” on his deal because “the meaningful vote has been voided of meaning.”
    

            He then slipped further back to his old habits of sowing confusion. 
    

            “And to anticipate the questions that are coming from the benches opposite, I will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so,” he said. 
    

            While Johnson didn’t go as far as saying he wouldn’t send the letter, he left enough room for people to think he was going to do something to sabotage a delay. 
    

      
      

      

    

            And in a briefing with government officials after the Prime Minister’s statement, Downing Street declined to clarify anything.
    

            They said that “governments comply with the law,” but not that this government led by Johnson would. 
    

            In the end, three letters were sent from Downing Street before the Benn Act’s deadline, including an unsigned letter from the Prime Minister to EU Council President Donald Tusk requesting the Brexit delay and another stressing the government’s desire for the request to not be granted, a senior British government source told CNN.
    

            It appeared that Johnson was again engaging in a bit of deliberate ambiguity, a feature of his leadership since taking office in July. 
    

            It’s a mind boggling end to a long week in British politics. It was a week which was supposed to provide some answers, and those answers were supposed to come on Super Saturday. But they didn’t. Instead, Brexit remains in a state of flux with no one sure what comes next; politicians as divided on an outcome as the public. 
    

            It’s both unhealthy and unbecoming for a nation as wealthy and important as the UK to be so obsessed with an issue that becomes unresolvable. And voters will be only too happy to let politicians know when they finally get the chance to vote.

Heavy rain and threats of lightning storms at Baltusrol course
Leading players still to begin third round

            Play was abandoned on day three of the PGA Championship at Baltusrol Golf Club, New Jersey, after persistent rain and the continuing threat of lightning storms Saturday.
    

            The vast majority of the field was at least able to tee-off before the weather turned but the top 10 players after Thursday and Friday’s opening rounds were unable to begin.
    
This is what we're waiting to pass at Baltusrol.
 

            “Play for the day has been canceled. The third round of the 98th PGA Championship will resume at (7am) on Sunday,” read a tweet from the PGA Championship event.
    

            Meanwhile, a note to competitors shared on the official PGA website shortly after stated that the final round will begin at 8.40am Sunday in the same pairings as round three.
    

            That would appear to leave open the possibility of the leading players completing two rounds Sunday should there be no further weather delays. Otherwise, play will likely be extended through to Monday.
    
Play for the day has been canceled. The THIRD ROUND of the 98th PGA Championship will resume at 7:00a.m. on Sunday, July 31, 2016.
The FINAL ROUND will begin at 8:40a.m. staying in the same pairings as Round 3, starting from Tee #1 (approx. 8:40am–3:25pm starting times)

            The last time the PGA Championship was held at Baltusrol was in 2005 when adverse weather also meant a Monday finish was required.
    

            Robert Streb and Jimmy Walker remain joint leaders at nine-under-par despite not striking a ball Saturday.
    

            Jason Day and Emiliano Grillo are tied for third two shots back on seven-under-par with recent British Open champion, Henrik Stenson, on six-under-par.
    

            

    

            Kevin Kisner made the most of an early start Saturday to record an impressive 65 to move into a tie for sixth position at five-under-par alongside Martin Kaymer, Patrick Reed and Brooks Kopka.   
    

            Ireland’s Padraig Harrington also shot up the leaderboard with a 65 of his own to be tie for tenth at four-under-par.
    

            Phil Mickelson could only make a two-under-par 68 to move up to joint 48th position Saturday. 
    

            But the 2005 PGA Championship winner told reporters that a record major score could be achieved over the coming days.
    
""I think someone's going to shoot 61 or 62."" 
Phil Mickelson thinks history will be made this weekend at Baltusrol. 

            Streb notched up a record equaling 63 Friday and Mickelson believes that could be bettered thanks to the generous way the course is playing. 
    

            No player has ever shot lower than a 63 in a major tournament.
    

            

    

            “The golf course is susceptible to very low scoring,” Mickelson told reporters. “There is a low 60s round. I think somebody is going to break that 63 record in these next two days.” 
    

            “The greens are pristine. You can make a lot of putts. They are soft, so you can get the ball very close. I think that there’s that 61 or 62.”

            A couple in central 
 who thought they were being burgled were instead shocked to find an endangered brown 
 on their balcony.
    

            Annalisa Castagna and her husband, Claudio Paravano, were alarmed by a noise outside their property and went to investigate, only to find themselves face to face with a Marsican brown bear, Castagna 
 published Sunday.
    

            They had “a close encounter with the bear. We were face to face, less than a meter away,” she wrote. “I was able to count all the teeth he had in his mouth plus the red tongue.”
    

            Castagna said she “screamed in the bear’s face” and the animal then tried to reach her with its paw.
    

            The encounter happened at the couple’s home in the village of Pescosolido, home to fewer than 1,500 people, on the edges of the Abruzzo National Park in central Italy.
    

            The park is home to around 60 Marsican bears, which are smaller than those found in the Alps, “but they can still reach 200 kilos,” said town mayor Donato Bellisario.
    

            “Before going into hibernation, the bears are in a period of hyperphagia (extreme hunger), they need to store energy for the winter,” Bellisario told CNN on Wednesday. “We often see them in the village searching for fruit, bees’ hives, but they never attacked men.”
    

      
      

      

    

            Bellisario said he and a few guards from the national park had inspected the couple’s balcony to determine what had attracted the bear, but they couldn’t tell.
    

            While Castagna escaped unscathed from the encounter, Paravano “was forced to jump over the fence,” according to the Facebook post. He fell three meters (10 feet) and suffered a fractured pelvis, said Bellisario, and faces a couple of months of recovery. 
    

            Only a few days before that incident, a Marsican bear was spotted taking an evening bath in the fountain of a nearby village, San Donato Val Di Comino.  
    

            “The bear has arrived in the village and takes a bath in the fountain of the public garden,” reads the caption of a photo 
.
    

            The photo was taken by Vania Tramontozzi, whose husband runs a bar in the central square of the village.
    

            “The bear’s arrival was not initially noticed, it was really quiet,” she told CNN. “I assure you that seeing him so calm and relaxed inside the fountain, at about 7.45 pm, when people are still around, was a rare and exciting thing.”

            Security forces killed seven militants in a counterterrorism operation in Russia’s southern republic of Dagestan, security officials said Saturday, according to the country’s state news agency RIA Novosti. 
    

            The six men and one woman were killed after a siege in Makhachkala, capital city of Dagestan, Russia’s Anti-Terrorism Committee said in a prepared statement, RIA Novosti reported.
    

            The operation came after 16 people, including several police officers, were injured Friday in explosions from a grenade launcher and a car bomb targeting a restaurant in Makhachkala, the news agency reported, citing investigators.
    

            The investigators said that the seven killed Saturday included a local militant leader and the widow of a dead militant preparing for a suicide attack, RIA Novosti added.
    

            Some of them tried unsuccessfully to break out while a house was under siege overnight, state-run Itar-Tass reported, quoting security and law enforcement officials.
    

            The latest incident follows years of unrest linked to an Islamist insurgency in Dagestan and the North Caucasus region.
    

            It also came as Russian security forces have tried to address security concerns before next month’s Winter Olympics in Sochi, which is perhaps a 12-hour drive from Dagestan on the other side of the Caucasus range.
    

            Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that his government is doing “everything possible” to make sure the Olympics will be secure. What it will not do, he insisted in an address broadcast by several television networks, is shudder in the face of the threats.
    

            Concerns about security in Russia were heightened after twin bombings on public transit that killed more than 30 people in the southern city of Volgograd at the end of last month.
    

            Just Wednesday, another four militants and three Russian security force members died in a shootout in Dagestan.

            The gesture led to global headlines and the young fan even offered to give the medal back.

            At the time of the event, the player explained the reasoning behind his instinctive reaction: “A young fella snuck onto the field somehow but when he was coming up to give me a hug, he got smoked by a security guard, full-on tackled him.
    

            “The other fella was a big man so he was lucky he didn’t break his ribs or something. I think the moment got the better of him but he was just so excited to get onto the field with the All Blacks. I just thought I’d make it a night to remember for him.
    

            “Rather than have the medal hanging up at home, it’s going to hanging around that young fella’s neck. He can tell that story for a long time to come.”
    

            Williams will be definitely keeping hold of his new medal, with the former rugby league player tweeting his thanks to tournament officials.

Alister MacKenzie, a physician turned golf architect, designed famed Augusta National course
The Scot was enlisted to help by Bobby Jones, a multiple golf champion of the 1920s
MacKenzie never received full payment for his work and died before first Masters was held
Many of his design principles still permeate the course despite many changes over the years

            “Can you possibly let me have, at any rate, five hundred dollars to keep us out of the poor house?” 
    

            These are not the words you expect to hear from a man who designed one of the world’s most famous golf courses.
    

            Dr. Alister MacKenzie, the brains behind Augusta National’s revered contours and curves – elegantly showcased each year by the Masters – died pleading poverty in 1934 and begging for his fee.
    

            He never even saw his finished work before his death, which came less than three months before the first Masters tournament was held.
    

            “I have been reduced to playing golf with four clubs,” he wrote in a letter to Augusta National, recorded in 
a book by David Owen commissioned by the club.
    

            “I am at the end of my tether, no-one has paid me a cent since last June, we have mortgaged everything we have and have not yet been able to pay the nursing expenses of my wife’s operation.”
    

            MacKenzie, a physician turned golf architect, had embarked on a pilgrimage that had taken him from a modest town in northern England to the pacific coast in California.
    

            His journey incorporated a stint in the Boer War, which influenced his underpinning principles of course design, and saw his work evolve during the boom and bust years of the 1920s.
    

            By the time he was enlisted to build a championship course for all of America by its biggest sports star of the age, MacKenzie was the preeminent golf architect of his time.
    

            Bobby Jones had won the grand slam as an amateur in 1930 – capturing all four major tournaments in the calendar year – before he stunned the public by announcing his retirement aged just 28.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            He determined to construct an exclusive golf course in the sun-blushed south of the United States that would offer him twin benefits: sanctuary from his fame and a healthy stream of income.
    

            But though Jones declared himself delighted with the finished product, and its architect trumpeted Augusta as his finest creation, MacKenzie was almost destitute by the time he died.
    

            He halved his fee to $5,000 in a bid to be paid quickly, but clawed back just $2,000, with several other golf courses also slow to settle their debts.
    

            It was symptomatic of the financial difficulties Augusta encountered in its fledgling years, exacerbated by the Great Depression, a fact that seems inconceivable given the club’s towering strength in the present day.
    

            “Augusta struggled a lot in the early years and found it very hard to attract members they wanted,” Adam Lawrence, editor of Golf Course Architecture magazine, told CNN.
    

            “They were really struggling for money. MacKenzie didn’t get full payment paid for his work at Augusta – until he died he was writing letters asking perhaps they could send part of the fee.
    

            “MacKenzie divorced his first wife and was living what would appear to be an expensive lifestyle in California. He was basically bankrupt when he died.
    

            “There were a lot of golf architects from that time who were the same. Most seemed to be terrible businessmen and there were a few bad habits like too much booze flying around.”
    

            

    

            MacKenzie’s portrait still watches over the course where his maverick design ideas were first put into practice over 100 years ago.
    

            Despite the odd tweak, Alwoodley Golf Club – just outside the city of Leeds in the north of England – still boasts many of the original characteristics conceived by the Scot.
    

            As Nick Leefe, secretary of the Alister MacKenzie Society, told CNN, the physician’s long-held affection for the game even permeated some of his diagnoses. 
    

            “How frequently have I, with great difficulty, persuaded patients who were never off my doorstep to take up golf, and how rarely, if ever, have I seen them in my consulting rooms again!” MacKenzie is reported to have proclaimed.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            This love of golf sparked an interest in course architecture after a period serving during the Second Boer War, between the British and the South African Republic, at the turn of the 20th century. 
    

            “The attitude of the Boers towards camouflage got him interested in disguise and trickery,” Leefe explains. “People suggest this is the reason he came back after the war and took an interest in golf design.”
    

            When a group of businessman joined together in 1907 to build Alwoodley, MacKenzie presented his designs and had them rubber-stamped by Harry Colt – another famed architect of the age who worked as a consultant on the project.
    

            MacKenzie’s fundamental belief was that a good golf course should provide a stern test for a good player but not prove impossible for average players.
    

            Also included in his manifesto was an insistence that a player should be required to utilize a variety of shots to prosper and that every hole should have a different character where possible.
    

            Among the more eccentric attributes listed was the suggestion that though the course should be sufficiently undulating, there should be no hill climbing, and that a complete absence of irritation caused by looking for lost balls was preferable.
    

            “Alwoodley is very proud indeed because we have the original MacKenzie design and we are very proud to introduce people to it,” Leefe says.
    

            “MacKenzie was a pioneer and went on to become one of the best known architects of his time. He’s become much more famous after his death and the golfing public have realized what great courses he’s made.
    

            “There are a lot of the original MacKenzie characteristics on show at Alwoodley. We try our best when we restore the course or renovate course to keep to the original design of which we have a copy.”
    

            

    

            MacKenzie had carved a formidable reputation for himself by the time he left for the United States in 1926.
    

            But it was his work on the Californian coast that would pique the interest of Bobby Jones and lead to his most memorable tender – designing Augusta National.
    

            Many believe MacKenzie’s true masterpiece to be Cypress Point, which he designed to complement its proximity to the rugged Pacific Ocean coastline.
    

            By the time Jones had completed his first round on the Monterey Peninsula he vowed to employ MacKenzie to build his very own course.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            It seemed the logical choice, given how closely their vision for the ideal golf course was.
    

            “We believe that no good golf hole exists that does not afford a proper and convenient solution to the average golfer and the short player, as well as to the more powerful and accurate expert,” Jones was reported as saying.
    

            But by the time $100,000 had been spent transforming an Augusta fruit plantation into a golf course, the political and financial landscape had changed dramatically thanks to the stock market crash of 1929.
    

            The exuberant flourishes on show via a series of elaborate bunkers at Cypress Point and another of MacKenzie’s fabled courses – Royal Melbourne in Australia – gave way to a more modest design in which contour was king.
    

            “Originally, Augusta was light on bunkers – it has many more today than it used to have,” says Lawrence. “Augusta was one of the very last things MacKenzie did before he died and it seems he was moving away from those flashy bunkers. 
    

            “He was working in a style that was appropriate of the era of depression when Augusta was built. It wasn’t about sand or water – what defined it were the contours of the land.
    

            “You can take a flag stick and put in a flat area and it’s a very easy golf hole; you can put it behind a little hump and it’s an almost impossible golf hole.”
    

            

    

            In those early years of struggle, the notion of Augusta preparing to host the 78th installment of the Masters in 2014 would have seemed quite fanciful.
    

            As Owen reports in “The Making of the Masters,” let alone having the funds to pay MacKenzie for his design, the club could barely cover its staff’s $200 weekly wage bill in the early 1930s.
    

            The idea to create a yearly tournament, initially called the Augusta National Invitational Tournament, helped stave off the threat of financial ruin and generated plenty of interest when Jones came out of retirement to play in the first one. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            But what really catapulted the club into the public’s consciousness was Gene Sarazen’s “shot heard around the world” during the 1935 event.
    

            The American was trailing the leaders by three shots when his double eagle on the par-five 15th hole helped him cut the deficit with one stroke, paving the way for his eventual win in a playoff.
    

            That landmark moment is testament to the principals upon which MacKenzie’s design was built. 
    

            Various tweaks over the years have stripped many of his original features from the course, most of them dictated by the modern player’s ability to hit the ball over a hundred yards further than their predecessors.
    

            But as Owen wrote: “MacKenzie’s and Jones’ ideas about golf course design continue to define the Masters in ways that modern golf fans may not fully appreciate.”
    

            The pair’s commitment to break from the culture of golf design at the time – which penalized poor shots harshly – has engendered some of the greatest finishes in major golf.
    

            As Owen makes clear, the plentiful birdie and eagle opportunities down the closing stretch discourage any conservatism, as anyone in with a sniff of winning charges for the finish line.
    

            But it’s not just at Augusta that MacKenzie’s legacy is felt – an estimated 100 clubs as far afield as Buenos Aires and Blackpool have been touch by his hand.
    

            “MacKenzie is undoubtedly one of the most important figures in terms of the evolution of golf course design,” Lawrence says.
    

            “Augusta, Cypress Point and Royal Melbourne are three courses that would typically be in the top 10 in the world in most rankings, and the fact all three courses have MacKenzie’s footprint is pretty impressive.”
    

            MacKenzie may be long gone, but he lives on in the soul of golf courses the world over.

Rupert Murdoch, owner of The Sun, tweeted the Page 3 girl might be outdated
Even one former model now says it is time for Page 3 to end
The Sun uses its models in journalism campaigns and marketing

            The UK’s highest selling newspaper may be embarking on a giant cover up – much to the delight of its critics – and putting an end to a tradition opponents see as sexist and outdated.
    

            The Sun’s topless model on Page 3 has been a tradition since the 1970s. A  photo of a bare-breasted young woman along with a corny caption was the newspaper’s way of giving its largely male readers a break from the often depressing news of the day.
    

            Page 3 quickly became part of The Sun’s brand, making the transition from black and white photos to color, then onto the paper’s website. Page 3 models often support The Sun’s campaigning journalism and are taken on tours to meet serving military.
    

            Nudity in newspapers is not the exclusive domain of The Sun. The press and advertising campaigns will often use flesh to draw in the eyeballs in parts of Europe.
    

            But now The Sun’s owner Rupert Murdoch – 
 – has raised the specter of a world without Page 3. Murdoch said: “
 page three so last century! You maybe right, don’t know but considering. Perhaps halfway house with glamorous fashionistas.”
    

            Murdoch later tempered this, saying it was the editor’s call. But it was music to the ears of campaigners at “
.”  The campaign was started by Lucy Holmes when she realized the day after Jessica Ennis won Olympic gold in the heptathlon for Great Britain last summer “the largest female image in The Sun was of a young woman showing her breasts.”
    

            On April 1, it had 88,000 signatures supporting an end to Page 3. 
 and has many more readers as each copy sold is read by friends or family.
    

            A spokesperson for News International said: “In a YouGov survey commissioned last October almost two thirds of 
 and notably it has more than seven million readers daily of which 45 per cent are female. It remains the UK’s biggest selling newspaper which means its formula – brilliant journalism, entertainment, outstanding sports writing – and Page 3, is working.”
    

            The YouGov survey also found readers of most of the other national papers were more likely to favor an end to the Sun’s Page 3.
    

            Meanwhile, the UK media landscape is changing after the Leveson Inquiry into phone hacking. 
, its sister paper The News of the World was closed by Murdoch and codes of conduct are being imposed on the media. The emphasis is on ethics, and that might not sit well on Page 3.
    

            One anti-Page 3 campaigner, Laura Ashton, told CNN: “It’s exploitative, it’s from the 1970s, and the girls back then were very young they were putting in the newspaper. They’re not much older now. But it really feels very outdated, that kind of sexism.”
    

            Others have tried before. Clare Short was a leading Labour Party MP when in 1986 she tried unsuccessfully to push through legislation that would have outlawed topless models in newspapers.  In 2007, Short tried again, only for The Sun to launch a “
” campaign with models being driven by bus to pose outside to the former MP’s home.
    

            In the UK, topless and nude model magazines are largely restricted to the top shelves of stores  where children can’t reach them. Only a couple of newspapers containing nudity are put on bottom shelf.
    

            Elsewhere in Europe, different standards apply in different markets with topless models used on advertising hoardings for everything from soap to sweaters.
    

            Some of the UK’s Page 3 models have used their exposure as  launchpad for other careers. Sam Fox, perhaps the best-known of them, had a string of pop hits.
    

            And Linda Lusardi, another pin-up of the 1980s, became an actress in long-running UK shows like “The Bill” and “Emmerdale.” 
    

            But even Lusardi, voted by Sun readers in 2005 as the best Page 3 girl ever, said: “It’s time for it to go. I really think things have moved on so far with the internet and with everything else that I don’t feel that we really need that in our national newspapers anymore.”

2013-05-21 09:39:00+00:00,,"Some of tennis' biggest names, including Roger Federer, have been felled by mono
Extensive training, matches and traveling may make players more vulnerable
Diagnosing the illness can be difficult, says an expert who has worked with athletes with mono
The men's tennis tour says cases of mono haven't been unusually high 

            Christina McHale, energy sapped and unable to train properly, knew something was wrong last year. Exercises she once did easily were becoming harder and getting through matches was proving difficult, too. 
    

            It was a surprise, since the young American prospect was considered a player with good stamina and has already earned a reputation for wearing down her opponents, not vice versa.  
    

            After a first-round victory at the French Open, McHale felt particularly exhausted.
    

            “I won 6-4 in the third set, but I remember saying to my coach that I feel like I’ve just been hit by a bus,” the 21-year-old recalled. 
    

            At first she thought it was a sinus infection. Then a couple of months later, following the Olympic tennis event at Wimbledon, McHale picked up a stomach bug and had to go to hospital. Her ordeal dragged on. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “I kept going back to the doctors because I wasn’t getting better,” McHale said. “I was still feeling very low on energy and they were like, ‘No, you should already be over the stomach virus.’ So then they started doing more tests, and that’s when they found out what it was.” 
    

            The diagnosis was mononucleosis, a viral illness that can linger for weeks, months or even years. It has earned the nickname of the “kissing disease” because it can get passed from one person to another through saliva. Fortunately for McHale, her bout was coming to an end. 
    

            McHale, though, isn’t the only tennis player in recent years to be afflicted with mono or the name it’s also known by, glandular fever. 
    

            

    

            Top men’s players Roger Federer, Andy Roddick, Robin Soderling, Mario Ancic and John Isner have been struck down, while Heather Watson, like McHale a player with promise, revealed she had mono in April. 
    

            Jarmila Gajdosova, another promising player on the women’s tour, announced last week on Twitter that she had mono. 
    

            Soderling and Ancic weren’t as lucky as the likes of Federer, McHale and Watson, who hopes to return to action at the French Open, which starts this weekend. Indeed the severity of cases varies, as does an individual’s capacity to fight off and cope with infections. 
    

            

    

            Soderling, the French Open finalist in 2009 and 2010, hasn’t played since 2011 and it is looking increasingly likely that he won’t ever come back. 
    

            The Swede with the massive forehand – who handed Rafael Nadal his only defeat at Roland Garros – started to feel unwell in the spring of 2011 and later said it was a mistake to compete at Wimbledon that year.  
    

            Ancic, hailed as a potential winner at Wimbledon after reaching the semifinals in 2004, attempted to play through his flu-like symptoms during a Davis Cup series against Germany in 2007.
    

            He said he felt so dizzy in his singles opener he missed a ball completely, but he still contested the doubles a day later. 
    

            He was ready to play the deciding fifth rubber if needed, although with Germany already clinching the tie he was replaced by a young Marin Cilic. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “God saved me,” Ancic, known for his work ethic and willingness to play through injuries, said in an interview in 2007.    
    

            Ancic re-emerged on the tour but was never the same and a teary-eyed Croatian had to retire two years ago aged 26. 
    

            Andy Murray, the current world No. 2, feared he had mono four years ago, and it’s an illness he’s still wary of, telling the Daily Telegraph in March: “You can get run down and end up missing two or three months of the year because of an illness.
    

            “Your immune system gets run down and then you lose weight. It’s happened with a lot of guys with glandular fever the last few years so it’s something everyone has to look into.”  
    

            
 
    

            Former pro Justin Gimelstob isn’t surprised that tennis players are susceptible.
    

            The players have to, at times, switch continents on a weekly basis, and they travel 10-11 months in a year.
    

            Unlike golf, cricket or Formula One, others sports that require continual global travel, the players also push themselves to the limit physically. 
    

            The career of Gimelstob, who now commentates and serves as a player representative on the ATP World Tour’s board of directors, was blighted by a back injury. 
    

            “I think that’s the thing people don’t understand – the heightened intensity does damage to your body, immune system, energy levels, on the fitness of your muscles, ligaments, tendons,” Gimelstob said.
    

            “It’s just a very tough sport. I truly believe that Nadal, Murray, (Novak) Djokovic and Federer, these guys aren’t only the best tennis athletes in the world, they are some of the best athletes in the world.
    

            “There’s a whole culture of being tough and strong and pushing through pain and being a warrior. 
    

            “But I can tell you right now at 37 years old walking my dog, my body feels the brunt of probably doing a lot of things and pushing through barriers I probably shouldn’t have. That’s the product of an individual sport.” 
    

            

    

            At first Leslie Findley, a consultant neurologist in England who has treated marathon runners, footballers and tennis players with mono, said it was a “myth” that those involved in tennis are more vulnerable than other athletes. 
    

            But he subsequently acknowledged that when factoring in their travel, the severity of the illness can intensify. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “We know people with fatigue illnesses related to the effects of viruses travel badly,” he said.
    

            “If you take someone with a chronic fatigue syndrome and stick them on an airplane at (London’s) Heathrow to the United States they’ll do an eight-hour flight. That can have a devastating effect on them for days afterwards.”
    

            Preventing mono can be difficult, but Findley said it’s important that players heed warnings. If they suddenly develop a cold, fever, sore throat or stomach issues, it’s vital to rest instead of continuing to train and play matches. 
    

            
 
    

            As Gimelstob pointed out and Findley knows through his own experience in working with sportsmen and women, that isn’t always easy. 
    

            “When you and I have the flu, we go to bed and within a week or two we’d be back to normal,” Findley said.
    

            “Why these people get symptoms that go on for weeks, months and years is usually because – and I’m now generalizing – they don’t stop when they have the first symptoms and tend to push through, and they’re under stress.”   
    

            Diagnosing mono isn’t simple, either, said Findley.
    

            He said there is a lack of specialists and that doing a battery of tests at the outset may not be efficient. He will usually spend nearly two hours talking to patients in a first consultation before making a clinical diagnosis. 
    

            “Then there are a limited number of blood tests that need to be done to make sure there is nothing else contributing to it,” Findley said. 
    

            The women’s tennis tour said in an email that player health and well being was a “priority.” But the age of many of its pros is another reason why tennis players would appear to be at risk.   
    

            “Mononucleosis most commonly occurs in people between the ages of 15 and 24, which is our athlete population,” said Kathleen Stroia, senior vice president, sport sciences and medicine & transitions, with the WTA.  
    

            The men’s tour said in an email that mono “has not been of unusual concern for the players or the ATP Medical Services.” 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “Professional athletes are not immune to illnesses which affect the general public in general,” said Gary Windler, medical advisor to the ATP World Tour. 
    

            “While we are concerned about and take all injuries and illness seriously, and although some high profile players have suffered from glandular fever in recent years, the incidence of this particular illness amongst our players in general has not been unusually high.” 
    

            McHale didn’t think her tour needed to do more to help players.   
    

            “I think we’re probably more susceptible to getting it because our bodies are more run down from traveling so much,” she said.
    

            “Also sometimes I take a water bottle – they all look the same – to the court and all of a sudden I’m like, ‘This wasn’t my water bottle.’ Sometimes it gets transferred like that.
    

            “I know a lot of my friends have gotten it. They’re not athletes. For them it wasn’t a big issue. It’s amplified when you’re an athlete.”
    

            

    

            Her road back hasn’t been smooth. 
    

            McHale, like others before her, didn’t stop playing for a while. But after losing five straight matches, she finally decided to sit out the remainder of 2012 and not contest the European indoor swing. The losing streak rose to eight by the time this January’s Australian Open ended. 
    

            As high as No. 24 in the world last summer, her health issues largely contributed to her ranking sliding to 55th.  
    

            She has resumed training fully and played for nearly three hours against 2012 French Open finalist Sara Errani in Rome on Wednesday but knows she must be careful.
    

            “They did tell me there’s a chance I could get a relapse, so I have to take it easy if I’m feeling extremely exhausted,” she said. “But I think I’m past that point. I don’t feel any side effects of what I had. I feel like I’m fully over it now. I was lucky my case wasn’t extremely bad like some others.”

            With the words of USA teammate 
 resounding in her ears – “Go out and kill floor” – gymnast Jade Carey did just that at the Tokyo 
 on Monday.
    

            Carey finished eighth in Sunday’s vault final – she made a mistake on the first of her two vaults – but the American was back to her best as she won the gold medal in the women’s floor exercise with a score of 14.366 at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
    

            Italian Vanessa Ferrari claimed silver – her first Olympic medal in her fourth Games – while bronze went to Angelina Melnikova of the 
and Japan’s Mai Murakami.
    

            “Coming back from a day like yesterday, I’m really proud of myself for being able to put that behind me and finish with probably the best floor routine I’ve ever done in my life,” Carey told reporters as she reflected on the difference in her vault and floor performances.
    

            “Yesterday was very tough for me,” added Carey. “I tripped, I guess, in my hurdle, or right before. I don’t even know. It’s kind of a blur now. It was really hard, but I’m glad I’m safe and healthy. Doing that second vault, it was a challenge, but I didn’t want to give up. For tonight, I just had to let that go and give it my all.”
    

            According to Carey, all her USA gymnastics teammates were supportive of her after the vault final, but that Biles “especially” helped the 21-year-old gymnast “let it go and move on.”
    

            “She said: ‘It happened, and you can’t do anything about it.’ She was like, ‘Let’s go out and kill floor,’ and that’s what I did.”
    

            Carey is coached by her father Brian, and the American gymnast said having him at the Ariake Gymnastics Centre meant “everything” to her.
    

            “This is all we’ve ever dreamed of,” said the US gymnast. “It’s really special to be able to get this medal with him out there by my side.
    

            “I talked to my dad last night, and we decided together that we were just going to let it go the best we could, and both put everything we could into tonight.”
    

            Earlier on Monday, Team USA confirmed 
would take part in Tuesday’s balance beam final.
    

            Biles – arguably the greatest gymnast of all time – participated in the Olympic qualifications on July 25 and then in the US’s vault rotation in the women’s team final on July 27 before withdrawing from competitive action, citing mental health concerns.

            The 
 have released a new image of their son, 
, in honor of Father’s Day. 
    

            The photo, which appeared on the royal couple’s 
, features Archie clutching Prince Harry’s finger. “Wishing a very special first Father’s Day to The Duke of Sussex,” the post states. 
    

            The couple also posted a photo in May in honor of Mother’s Day in the many countries across the globe that celebrate it, including Meghan’s native America. 
    

            “Paying tribute to all mothers today – past, present, mothers-to-be, and those lost but forever remembered,” the post stated, “We honor and celebrate each and every one of you.”
    

            The photos are the only times that Archie has been seen since he was presented to the world in St. George’s Hall in Windsor Castle only days after his birth on May 6. 
    

            New details have just emerged about Archie’s christening, which is set to take place at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle in July, according to 
. 
    

            Richard Fitzwilliams, a royal expert, told CNN that the christening will almost certainly take place at the chapel as it is where Harry was christened in 1984, and where he and Meghan tied the knot in May 2018. 
    

            More recently, the chapel has played host to the weddings of Prince Andrew’s daughter Princess Eugenie to Jack Brooksbank in October 2018, and Lady Gabriella Windsor to financier Thomas Kingston in May 2019. 
    

            Fitzwilliams noted that the christening will be a “highly significant” event, as Archie is the first royal baby born to parents of different ethnicities. He noted that the christening will highlight a “changing royal family which reflects society as a whole in modern Britain as in the Commonwealth more closely.” 
    

            Yet despite Meghan’s push for modernity, which has included championing women’s rights, the christening is expected to be a traditional affair, Fitzwilliams added.
    

            Archie will reportedly be baptized with water from the River Jordan, which holds particular significance for the Jewish and Christian faiths, as it is believed to be where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. 
    

            The paper added that the royal baby will also be dressed in an exact replica of the historic royal christening gown, which was commissioned by Queen Victoria and first used in 1841 for the baptism of her eldest daughter, Princess Victoria. 
    

            The original, which was made from Spitalfields silk and Honiton lace, was worn by 62 royal babies, including Queen Elizabeth at her christening in 1926, Prince Harry and Prince William. 
    

            A replica of the gown was commissioned by the Queen in 2004, however, as the original was deemed too fragile for further use. The most recent royal babies to don the replica were Prince George in 2013 and Princess Charlotte in 2015. 
    

            The christening will also feature the Lily Font, a silver-gilt receptacle which was commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1840, the Sunday Times added. 
    

            The font, which is stored at the Tower of London when not in use, has been used for the christenings of all of the Queen’s children and grandchildren, excluding Princess Eugenie. 
    

            Fitzwilliams noted that royal christenings are often small and private affairs, which are attended by “senior royals, family, close friends and the godparents and their spouses.” 
    

            The Queen is nevertheless expected to be absent at the celebrations due to prior engagements, according to the newspaper. While the monarch attended the christenings of Prince George and Princess Charlotte in recent years, she was noticeably absent from Prince Louis’s baptism last year.
    

            The ceremony is expected to be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Right Reverend David Conner, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who is head of the Church of England. 
    

            Conner has recently conducted the marriage ceremonies of Meghan and Harry, Princess Eugenie and Lady Gabriella Windsor.

Maurice Hamilton is a Formula One author and journalist and has been covering the sport for more than four decades. He has attended more than 450 grands prix and written 19 books.


            It’s been a thrilling Formula One season and as the 2018 campaign reaches its conclusion on Sunday at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, CNN Sport takes a look at some of the cars that have defined the sport over the years.
    

            As race statistics go, the Maserati 250F barely makes an impression; just eight Grand Prix wins and a single drivers’ title between 1954 and 1959. 
    

            Aside from the constructors’ championship not being created until 1958, the paucity of results makes no difference to the 250F’s reputation as one of the finest and most graceful F1 cars ever built. 
    

            Having raced before and after World War II, the Italian firm produced the 250F to meet a change to 2.5-litre engines in Formula 1 for 1954.
    

            

    

            

    

            From the moment it first appeared, the Maserati satisfied the ideal of what a Grand Prix car should look like; pure of line, the long, gently curved bodywork with its low snout finished off in a rich red, the Italian national racing color. 
    

            Not only was the 250F aesthetically satisfying, it was also a pleasure to drive. A finely balanced chassis allowed drivers to use the throttle as a means of powering the 250F through corners with the shapely tail hanging out. 
    

            The Argentine maestro, Juan Manuel Fangio, used the 250F to display his thrilling virtuosity as he won the 1957 world championship with ease. 
    

            Surviving examples change hands at auction for seven figure sums; an indication of arguably the most iconic F1 car of all time.
    

            Colin Chapman, the boss of Lotus and an engineering genius, revolutionized racing car construction by designing the monocoque chassis. 
    

            This fully stressed aluminum bathtub shape was three times stiffer and half the weight of the popular structure of welded tubes making up a so-called space frame chassis. 
    

            Introduced halfway through 1962, the Lotus 25 was instantly competitive and would have won the championship but for an engine failure at the final race. 
    

            Coupled with driving brilliance of Jim Clark, however, the Lotus 25 totally dominated the 1963 championship with seven wins. 
    

            The monocoque construction would become the standard for F1 design, spreading eventually to every racing formula.  
    

            Clark would also have won the 1964 world title but for an engine failure on the last lap of the final race – a development of the concept, the Lotus 33, easily took Clark to his second championship the following year. 
    

            A major change of formula for 1966 gave Chapman the opportunity to advance his thinking further with the Lotus 49 by attaching the engine directly to the monocoque (as opposed to supporting it in a separate frame). 
    

            The 49 went on to win the championship with Graham Hill in 1968 (the year Clark was killed in a Formula 2 race).
    

            The Brabham BT20 (and its BT19 predecessor) is unusual among F1 engineering icons because of its relative simplicity. 
    

            Having won world championships driving for Cooper in 1959 and 1960, Jack Braham decided to run a team and build his own grand prix car. 
    

            Brabham had moderate success in 1964 and 1965 but a change of engine formula for 1966 provided the perfect opportunity for the wily and pragmatic Australian.  
    

            While major manufacturers such as Ferrari and BRM chose to build complex engines specifically for the new 3-litre formula, Brabham figured that a known and uncomplicated power unit would bring immediate results while rivals found their feet. 
    

            Accordingly, he took an American Oldsmobile V8 to Repco and had the Australian engineering firm develop what had been a production unit. It may not have been as powerful as some, but it was reliable.  
    

            Initially using a BT19 (almost identical to the BT20), Brabham won four grands prix to take his third title and become the first – and in all probability – the only man to win a championship in a car bearing his own name.  
    

            Brabham’s clever strategy continued when the Brabham-Repco BT24 of his team-mate, Denny Hulme, was good enough to win the 1967 world championship.
    

            The basic profile of F1 cars was altered forever in 1970 when Chapman produced the Lotus 72.  
    

            The most striking change involved side-mounted radiators, thus making way for a wedge shape, starting with a broad chisel nose. This optimized the car’s aerodynamics; a rich, new territory for F1 designers.
    

            Unsatisfactory handling delayed the debut and prompted a major redesign of the suspension. Proof that a cure had been found came when Jochen Rindt won the car’s first grand prix in Holland. 
    

            Victories at three more races put Rindt in line for the championship but the Austrian was killed when a brake shaft snapped and sent the Lotus into the crash barrier during practice for the Italian Grand Prix. 
    

            Rindt would become the sport’s first posthumous world champion. Development of the Lotus 72 proved unsuccessful in 1971 but a further iteration brought Emerson Fittipaldi his first world title the following year. 
    

            Such was the fundamental sophistication of the car that continuing improvements ensured Lotus won the 1973 constructors’ championship, the drivers’ title being compromised by championship points split between Fittipaldi and Ronnie Peterson. 
    

            Amazingly, the Lotus 72 continued to be raced by the works team and privateers into 1975, five years after its conception.
    

            Reacting to a new rule in 1973 demanding F1 cars to have side-impact structures, McLaren chose to fully integrate these into the design rather than follow the popular trend of adding crushproof pads to the sides. 
    

            The resulting McLaren M23 had strength, simplicity and integrity throughout its wedge-shape design, although teething problems would affect the early races. 
    

            Three wins were no match for Tyrrell and Lotus in 1973 but the incorporation of lessons learned brought the drivers’ (Emerson Fittipaldi) and constructors’ titles with four victories the following year. 
    

            The M23 was substantially unaltered for 1975 when consistent finishes and three wins were not enough to beat the faster Ferraris. 
    

            McLaren continued to have faith in the design, reducing its weight and revising the suspension along with small but significant changes in readiness for 1976. 
    

            Fittipaldi’s eleventh hour departure left an opening for James Hunt, the Englishman seizing his chance with such a well-developed car. 
    

            Overcoming an early technical glitch, McLaren won six races during an epic season than ran to the wire, Hunt taking the title by a single point from Ferrari’s Niki Lauda. 
    

            The M23 had been developed through five specifications to ensure its front-line competitiveness across four seasons, making it one of F1’s most successful cars.
    

            Christened “Black Beauty” because of its elegant lines and black and gold colours, the Lotus 79 redefined F1 car design and performance. It was arguably the best of Chapman’s many flashes of genius.
    

            Searching for another unexplored advantage, the head of Lotus applied his fertile mind to harnessing the passage of air through and under the car. 
    

            The initial concept was developed throughout 1977 with the Lotus 78, the unique feature being inverted wings hidden in the sidepods that helped suck the car to the ground. 
    

            Lotus won five grands prix that year and would have been in the championship reckoning but for a number of mainly engine-related failures. 
    

            Development was helped by a rare driver/engineer empathy between Chapman and Mario Andretti (similar to the relationship with Clark). 
    

            The product of their work was the Lotus 79, a car that would refine the so-called ground effect phenomenon from the moment it first appeared in 1978. 
    

            Backed up by Ronnie Peterson, Andretti became world champion, Lotus dominating the season with eight wins to walk off with the constructors’ championship. 
    

            It was to be the height of Chapman’s ambition – and the start of a terminal decline at Lotus as the next car, the 80, was a complete flop.
    

            In September 1980, the ailing McLaren team was reformed to become McLaren International. 
    

            Technical director John Barnard, always searching for a new direction, was to make one of the biggest breakthroughs in F1 design when he abandoned the now traditional aluminium chassis in favour of one made from molded carbon fiber. 
    

            It was complex, but immensely strong and light – the two perpetual overarching aims in racing car design. Barnard also introduced a level precision and perfection hitherto unseen in racing car construction. 
    

            The McLaren MP4/1 made its debut in 1981, John Watson winning the British Grand Prix in the same year. 
    

            Watson and Niki Lauda used updated versions to win grands prix in 1982 and 1983 but the team’s competitiveness was being increasingly limited by the lack of a turbocharged engine to match those used by the competition. 
    

            Refining the same carbon fibre development, Barnard produced the MP4/2 to accept a bespoke TAG-Porsche turbo V6. 
    

            This car dominated 1984 with Lauda winning the drivers’ title by half a point from his team-mate Alain Prost in 1984, before Prost took his turn the following year. 
    

            Barnard moved to Ferrari but left behind a powerful legacy that would assist McLaren to further championships with the MP4/4.
    

            Continuing his quest for substantial innovation following his move to Ferrari, Barnard thought long and hard about how to remove the bulky manual gear lever and rod running through the right-hand side of the cockpit to the gearbox mounted at the rear. 
    

            The idea of using a semi-automatic transmission was initially linked to a push-button gear selector on the steering wheel, Barnard eventually settling for paddles behind the wheel to work in tandem with a hydraulically operated clutch. 
    

            The associated reduction in cockpit dimensions allowed a narrow chassis, a sharp, slim nose and wide sidepods to house the radiators and maximise aerodynamic efficiency. 
    

            At first, the striking appearance of the red car was not matched by reliability, persistent problems with the gearbox delaying the first race until the start of 1989 rather than, as originally planned, during the previous season. 
    

            The Ferrari 640 (also known as the F1-89) was fast but no one expected it to finish, least of Nigel Mansell as he took the V12-powered car to a remarkable win on its debut in Brazil. 
    

            A failure to finish another race until mid-season wrote off any chance of the championship, but Barnard’s innovation would change F1 transmission design forever.
    

            Williams had been working for some time on different avenues of F1 car development; semi-automatic gearboxes, traction control and active suspension. 
    

            They all came together in 1992 with the Williams FW14B, one of the most successful and arguably the most sophisticated F1 car of all time before regulatory control banned most of the complex systems involved. 
    

            The gearbox had been unreliable in 1991 but, once sorted, the driver could change gear four or five times faster without the risk of over-revving the engine. 
    

            Gradual work on active suspension – controlling the car’s ride height at a consistently efficient level – reached fruition with a switch from mechanical to a more effective electronic control, coupled with refinement of traction control. 
    

            The entire programme was overseen by technical director Patrick Head, who paid high tribute to the work of Adrian Newey as the designer packaged the multiple components into a workable and aerodynamically efficient form, coupled with a strong and powerful Renault V10 engine. 
    

            Mansell wrapped up the drivers’ championship five races before the end of the season thanks to a then record nine wins, Ricciardo Patrese’s victory in Japan and six second places helping Williams crush the opposition in the constructors’ championship.
    

            Any major change in the technical rules represents opportunity. There was none bigger in recent times than the switch from normally aspirated to hybrid turbocharged power units for 2014. 
    

            Mercedes were better prepared than most for this substantial shift in F1 thinking. 
    

            Broadly speaking, in the past a team would receive the completed power plant from a manufacturer (possibly from within their own company), install it in the chassis and go racing. 
    

            Mercedes saw the need for detailed integration of the two, the entire package created to deal with the complex requirements of associated energy recovery and its application. 
    

            The programme and detailed planning were helped by the race team being 45 minutes down the road from Mercedes High Performance Powertrains in Brixworth, Northamptonshire. 
    

            And the final key factor was Lewis Hamilton making the bold decision to leave McLaren and align his future with Mercedes. 
    

            Six wins in succession (four for Hamilton and two for Nico Rosberg) at the start of the season set a standard that would continue, not just through 2014, but across five years as the Mercedes W05 template formed the basis for one the most dominant series of cars in the history of F1.

Of those, 11,597 detainees have since been released while 5,685 people remain in custody but have yet to go before a judge.

2018-10-24 08:53:00+00:00,,"Ronaldo returned to Old Trafford 
Manchester United 0-1 Juventus
Ronaldo instrumental in Dybala's goal

            Cristiano Ronaldo was the last player to leave the Old Trafford pitch, serenaded as he made his way to the tunnel by the Manchester United fans who had remained with a rendition of “Viva Ronaldo,” the adaptation of the Elvis riff once commonplace on these terraces a decade or so ago. 
    

            The Juventus star had not played on the ground where he first made his name since the Sir Alex Ferguson years. On this floodlit Champions League night in England’s north-west, he was warmly welcomed. 
    

            Street sellers sold scarves with his images and the words ‘The Legend Returns’ and, as he appeared for the warm-up, both sets of fans scattered inside the stadium applauded. Even after the final whistle a pitch-invader appeared to take a selfie with the former United player. He is seemingly still admired. 
    

            

    

            

    

            To the United fans who remember better times, the presence of their former No.7 and his contribution to the Italians’ 1-0 victory was a stark reminder of those Ferguson years, when winning with flair, accumulating trophies and going toe-to-toe with Europe’s most accomplished sides was routine. 
    

            Images of the Portuguese still adorn the corridors of Old Trafford, his record during his six-year spell at the club testimony as to why – 118 goals in 292 appearances, three league titles, a Champions League crown and extraordinary displays which elevated his status to the greatest the English Premier League has seen.  
    

            But things are different now. The Red Devils are not the force they were, while Ronaldo is much changed from the player who dazzled with a repertoire of tricks, wreaking havoc from the wing, mesmerizing with his invention and craft, during his United years. 
    

            Since his then world record move to Real Madrid in 2009, the forward has become more efficient and ruthless. He is one of the greatest to have played the game. 
    

            It was the 33-year-old’s cross which led to Paulo Dybala goal, securing a victory which puts Juventus in command of Group H and needing just a point to progress from the group. 
    

            Ronaldo made his Old Trafford return with a rape allegation from 2009, which the forward has strongly denied, hanging over him and this fixture. 
    

            All eyes were on the Portuguese, but he wasn’t the only player in monochrome to shine as the Italians justified their status as one of the favorites to win Europe’s premier club competition with a dominant display.
    

            The hosts had just two shots on target over 90 minutes. United came closest to scoring when Paul Pogba’s shot hit the post after the break, but a leveler would have been undeserved. 
    

            At one point in the first half, Juventus enjoyed over 75% of possession and had restricted United to just one touch inside its penalty area. The stats did not improve much for United after the break – the English club ended the night with 39% possession and manager Jose Mourinho admitting that the Italians were at a “different level.”
    

            

    

            United had no-one of Ronaldo’s ilk on the pitch, but neither did Mourinho’s men have anyone as threatening as Dybala, or as commanding as Giorgio Chiellini. No-one in red drove at the opposition like Joao Cancelo or set the tempo like Rodrigo Bentancur. 
    

            But it is Ronaldo who will dominate the headlines, because he always does. 
    

            In the opening minutes he roved around the left, drawing a foul from Ashley Young – the first of plenty during the 90 minutes – and there were flicks and backheels to remind the home supporters of those electrifying years in red.
    

            Juventus’ No.7 was free to roam wherever he sniffed danger and it was from the right wing where he caused damage in the 17th minute, his low cross from the right finding the impressive Dybala, who side-footed home for his fourth Champions League goal of the season. 
    

            The Argentine could have added to his tally in the opening 45 minutes – heading wide and drawing a save from David de Gea with a drilled effort across goal, while Ronaldo went close from distance after the break, forcing a fine fingertip save from the Spaniard.
    

            During his first few months in Turin, Ronaldo has yet to reach the standards he set in Manchester and Madrid. But he has scored five goals for his new club and in his biggest match since his summer move added much to Juventus’ attack. 
    

            In truth. for all his footballing qualities, Ronaldo was bought by the Italian champions for a club record $117 million for his global appeal off the pitch as much as his genius on it. The Italians spent big on a player entering the final chapters of his career to propel them into football’s financial big league. 
    

            According to Deloitte, Juventus is the world’s 10th richest football club – its overall income $311 million lower than Tuesday’s opponents. 
    

            The allegation that Ronaldo raped a woman in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009, now subject of both a criminal investigation and a civil suit, had not emerged when he was purchased in July. 
    

            Ronaldo has denied any wrongdoing – during Monday’s news conference he cut a relaxed figure and 
 who was certain that the truth would come out – but there has been fallout.
    

            Earlier this month 
with the allegation made against a player with whom the company has a reported billion-dollar sponsorship deal, while shares in the Serie A club have plummeted. 
    

            It was not the sort of global spotlight Andrea Agnelli had envisioned when making his huge investment.
    

            

    

            But even last week, the Juve president said: “Juve is not just Ronaldo: it’s a collective. CR7 is a cherry in something that has been built one piece after the other, with patience, intelligence and much more.”
    

            The acquisition of Ronaldo could be the key to the Italian giants finally winning European club football’s top prize after a 22-year wait. 
    

            Despite competing in nine finals – a total surpassed by only Real Madrid, AC Milan and Bayern Munich – Juve has only won the title twice. On this showing, the Italians are justifiably favorites to claim the crown they covet most.

            Ralf Rangnick’s first game in charge of Manchester United ended in a 1-0 victory against Crystal Palace on Sunday. 
    

            United dominated possession and enjoyed more shots than Palace – 11 in the first half alone – but a goal proved elusive for much of the match. 
    

            However, Fred’s strike from the edge of the box in the 77th minute settled the contest and moved United up to 6th in the Premier League table.

 has penned a new multi-million dollar deal with U.S. insurance giant Aon as part of an aggressive marketing strategy aimed at driving revenue through sponsorship.
    

            One of 36 companies that now sponsor Manchester United, Aon will sign an eight-year contract to brand the club’s training kit and attach its name to United’s Carrington training ground. 
    

            The deal, which runs until 2021, is reportedly worth £15 million [$23 million] a season and will see the training ground renamed Aon Training Complex. 
    

            It is the first time the Premier League giants have sold the branding rights to their coveted training ground on the outskirts of Manchester and represents another step in the club’s strategy to drive up revenues.  
    

            For the 2011/2012 season, United increased revenues by £14.2 million to £117.6 million, the highest of any club in the Premier League, and have sponsorship deals with companies from Indonesian tyremakers to China Construction Bank.

Eight people were killed when the attacked rammed a van into pedestrians

            The ringleader of the London terror attack last week tried to rent a 7.5-ton truck, British police have said, indicating the attackers were looking to carry out a larger-scale assault.
    

            Three men rammed into pedestrians on London Bridge on the night of June 3 before going on a stabbing spree at bars and restaurants at the nearby Borough Market. Eight people were killed and the three attackers were shot dead by police.  
    

      
      

      

    

            London Metropolitan Police said the trio’s ringleader, 
, attempted to rent the large truck online on the morning of June 3 but did not provide payment details when prompted.
    

            Butt rented a white Renault van in the evening instead, using a recently activated mobile phone. 
    

            

    

            Large trucks have been used in other ramming attacks in Europe and have caused higher numbers of casualties. Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel killed 86 people in Nice, France, when he plowed through a large crowd celebrating the national Bastille Day last July. In Berlin, Anis Amri rammed into a Christmas market, killing 12. 
    

            Met Police confirmed to CNN that Butt was out on bail at the time of the attacks, having been arrested in a low-level fraud offense in October 2016.
    

            He wasn’t charged and was about to be released from bail because of insufficient evidence, the police said. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Two British counter-terrorism sources told CNN that the arrest was part of a drive by British police and the MI5 intelligence agency to take known Islamist extremists “off the streets” by going after them for crimes unrelated to terrorism. That drive was initiated two years previously.
    

            An official involved in the efforts said the arrests focused on members of the pro-ISIS group al Muhajiroun and likened it to “going after Al Capone for tax evasion.”
    

            The police and other counter-terrorism agencies have come under scrutiny after it emerged that Butt was under investigation when he carried out the attack.
    

            Police have released images of three pink ceramic kitchen knives found on or near the assailants. The Ernesto brand knives are 12 inches long, and were found with tape wrapped around the handles and leather straps attached to them to keep the weapons on the attackers’ wrists.
    

            “We’ve been working round the clock to understand what these men did in the lead-up to the attack but we need to know more about these unusual knives. Where have they come from? Where might the attackers have bought them from?” the Met’s counter-terrorism command chief Dean Haydon said, calling on the public to contact police if they had any information on the weapons.
    

            Police also released photos of the van the attackers used to mow down people on the bridge.
    

            Inside, they found 13 apparent Molotov cocktails made from wine bottles and a possible flammable liquid. There also were two blowtorches. 
    

            They found a number of office chairs and a suitcase, and believe that the attackers had told family they were using the van to move as a cover story.
    

            Police said the three men – 
, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba – had driven up and down London Bridge twice before carrying out the attack, in what appears to have been a dry run.
    

      
      

      

    

            Police have conducted a series of raids in connection with the attacks and made 18 arrests. Five people remain in custody and the other 13 have been released.
    

            In a raid of an east London apartment rented by Redouane, police found an English-language copy of the Koran opened at a page describing martyrdom and materials that may have been used to make the Molotov cocktails. 
    

            Police have arrested 19 people in connection with the attack. Six men are still in custody and one has been released on bail.

            The proposed £600 million ($788 million) purchase of London’s Wembley Stadium has fallen through after American businessman Shahid Khan withdrew his bid.
    

            Khan, who owns the NFL franchise Jacksonville Jaguars and English Premier League club Fulham, made the decision after his bid received criticism from some figures within English soccer.
    

            “The intent of my efforts was, and is, to do right by everyone in a manner that strengthens the English game and brings people together, not divides them,” Khan said in a statement on Wednesday. He had made his offer to England’s Football Association (FA) governing body public in April. 
    

            “I cannot rule out revisiting the opportunity at another time when perhaps the Football Association family is unified in its views on the opportunity,” Khan added.
    

      
      

      

    

            The FA had pledged to invest proceeds from the sale into the grassroots of English soccer, and Khan’s bid had received support from FA Chief Executive Martin Glenn.
    

            But former England defender Gary Neville had led criticisms of the proposal, telling a British parliamentary hearing in July that the plans were “a short-term plan we’ll regret forever.”
    

            Glenn said in a statement on Wednesday: “Mr. Khan believed that his offer to buy Wembley Stadium would release funds to help improve community football facilities in England and that it would be well received by all football stakeholders.
    

            “At a recent meeting with Mr. Khan he expressed to us that, without stronger support from within the game, his offer is being seen as more divisive than it was anticipated to be and has decided to withdraw his proposal,” Glenn added.
    

            The stadium, in the north-west of the British capital, was reopened in 2007 after a multi-million dollar rebuild. The previous site had opened in 1923 and quickly became known as the home of English football.
    

            As well as hosting home national soccer team games and other major matches, Wembley stages multiple NFL games each season – including one each year by Khan’s Jacksonville Jaguars.
    

            Wembley’s proposed purchase had been seen by many as a key move in the potential future relocation of an NFL team to London, though Khan repeatedly denied that he was intending to move the Jaguars abroad.
    

            Pakistani-born Khan is the 217th richest person in the world, according to Forbes, having made his money by developing auto parts.
    

            In 2013 he bought Fulham, a London-based soccer club that was promoted back into the Premier League in May by winning a play-off final at Wembley.
    

            Khan will be expected to watch the Jaguars when they face the Philadelphia Eagles at the stadium on October 28.

 and US President Joe Biden just

            “The refusal by a number of Western countries to engage in normal cooperation, including with Russian energy resources … is hitting millions of Europeans,” he said. “It’s sparked a real energy crisis.  It’s being reflected also in the United States. Everywhere inflation, prices are rising.”

            That sort of glass-half-full message may be meant to reassure uneasy Russians. But Putin is also presenting a blithe confidence about how the war in Ukraine is going, despite massive setbacks in the effort to “denazify” Ukraine – the Kremlin leader’s ugly shorthand for overthrowing the democratically-elected government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and ending Ukrainian statehood as we know it. 
    

            On Tuesday, Putin paid a visit to the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the Russian Far East, where he had a Cosmonautics Day photo opportunity with his partner in autocracy, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.  
    

            In remarks at the event, Putin dismissed widespread evidence of atrocities in the Ukrainian town of Bucha in the wake of the withdrawal of Russian troops, comparing them to “fake” reports about the use of chemical weapons in Syria by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.    
    

            “There were provocations in Syria, when the use of chemical weapons by the Assad government was planted. Then it turned out that it was fake, the same fake is in Bucha,” he said. 
    

            The US and Western governments reported multiple instances of the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government, with the White House saying the Assad regime had crossed a “red line” with the 
. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons concluded Assad’s forces were also responsible for a series of 
 in late March 2017.
    

      
      

      

    

            Putin singing the fake-news refrain is not new. But the Russian President did signal something substantial, saying during the same event that peace talks with Ukraine had hit “a dead end” and vowing that he “will not stop military operations” in Ukraine until his campaign succeeds. 
    

            What Putin’s real measure of success is remains anyone’s guess. 
    

            Some observers – and Western officials – have suggested his generals have a plan to press a big offensive in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, so they can present some evidence of tangible progress on the battlefield to their leader ahead of May 9, when Russia observes the Victory Day holiday. 
    

            If that deadline is real, then the clock is definitely ticking for Putin’s commanders.   
    

            Whether negotiations are indeed at a dead end is another matter. 
    

            Following Putin’s remarks, Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine and a lead negotiator in the Russia-Ukraine talks, countered that “
 Online in working subgroups. But they are ongoing.”  
    

            But Podolyak also suggested another factor: Unlike Russia’s political system, which is subject to the whims of one man, Ukraine’s government must contend with widespread outrage at the uncovering of widespread killings of civilians by Russian troops. 
    

            That will make the task of talking peace with Putin even harder.

Seven people had been arrested earlier in raids in Molenbeek, but five have been released

            The 
 has led authorities across the Belgian border to an impoverished suburb of Brussels with a history of links to terror plots.
    

            Belgian special operations forces, clad in balaclavas and with bomb disposal robots at the ready, cordoned off two streets as they raided a property in Molenbeek, a suburb of the Belgian capital, on Monday morning, according to a CNN team at the scene.
    

            Jean-Pascal Thoreau, a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor, later told CNN that no one was arrested in the raid.
    

            

    

            Earlier, Belgian state broadcaster RTBF, citing the country’s Federal Justice Department, had reported that police had made one arrest during the raid, but had not apprehended Salah Abdeslam, the French citizen at the center of a manhunt for his suspected involvement in the terror attacks.
    

            

    

            Two of those who attacked Paris on Friday have been identified as French citizens who lived in the Brussels suburb, Thoreau told CNN on Sunday, while two cars involved in the Paris shootings had Belgian license plates, according to his office.
    

            Seven people were arrested earlier in raids in Molenbeek after the Paris attacks, but five of them have been released, Thoreau told CNN on Monday.
    

            Among those released was Mohammed Abdeslam, brother of the wanted man. Thoreau told CNN that the released Abdeslam brother did not know his brother’s whereabouts.
    

            

    

            The developments have brought renewed focus on the threat posed by jihadist networks in Belgium, a country that, according to one analysis, has exported more jihadists to the conflicts in

            Molenbeek has a large, predominantly Muslim population of first-, second- and third-generation immigrants from North Africa that has gained an unwelcome reputation as a hotbed of jihadism.
    

            Belgium’s minister of justice, Koen Geens, told CNN’s Ivan Watson on Monday that his country had “a foreign fighters problem,” and he cited Molenbeek as an example of an area where more needed to be done to combat the threat.

            Abaaoud, who authorities suspect orchestrated the Verviers plot from Greece, is believed to have joined ISIS in Syria in early 2014, Guy Van Vlierden, editor of a blog on Belgian foreign fighters, told CNN this year. At some point, his 13-year-old brother joined him there, becoming the youngest Belgian jihadist in Syria.
    

            After the Verviers plot was foiled, Abaaoud evaded European authorities’ efforts to apprehend him. He later was featured in an ISIS propaganda magazine, claiming to have returned to Syria.
    

            

    

            Geens, the Belgian justice minister, told CNN on Monday that the jurisdictional divisions in the Brussels police force could hamper police efforts against the jihadist threat.  Brussels has 19 municipal mayors in charge of six police zones with their own local police forces.
    

            “The fact that Brussels is politically and – as to its police forces – a little bit more divided than one would expect from such a big city creates additional problems as to surveillance,” he told CNN’s Watson.
    

            “The main thing is the local and federal police have to work together continuously. Simple and normal criminality which has nothing to do with terrorism – but like false papers, false passports, weapon trade – are flourishing in certain suburbs of Brussels like in Molenbeek, and we absolutely have to counter these things with the help of local services.”
    

            In 
 in August, Alain Grignard, a senior member of the counterterror unit in the Brussels federal police and a lecturer on political 
 at the University of Liege, said the perpetrators of the Verviers plot fit a typical profile of Belgian jihadists: “men in their early 20s mostly from the Molenbeek district of Brussels moving in circles with a track record of delinquency and petty crime.” 
    

            “They were radicalized very quickly, and when they came back from Syria they had no fear of death,” Grignard 
, published in the 
’s publication, the CTC Sentinel. Cruickshank is also editor-in-chief of the CTC Sentinel.
    

            “These guys had maybe more experience in gun battles than our own commandos.”
    

            Like many European jihadists, they were an outgrowth of the “inner-city gang phenomenon,” he said, who had already revolted against Western society through petty crime and delinquency before having their antisocial approach “legitimized” by a radical strain of Islam.
    

      
      

      

    

            “These youngsters are getting quickly and completely sucked in. The next thing they know they’re in Syria and in a real video game,” he said.
    

            He told Cruickshank that the terror threat in Belgium, fueled by the trail of young jihadists to fight in Syria and Iraq, had “never been higher in all the years I’ve been working on counterterrorism.” 
    

            “To give you an idea of the scale of the challenge, in the past two years we’ve charged more people with terrorism offenses than in the 30 years before that,” he said. “It’s impossible to do surveillance on everybody.”
    

            Since 2012, he said, al Qaeda had been “trying to talent spot” Western jihadists on the battlefields of Syria for use in potential operations against the West, while ISIS had appeared more focused on state building. But since the start of the U.S.-led air campaign targeting ISIS, the concern had grown that ISIS would also focus on directly targeting Western countries. 
    

            “And the worry is that competition between al Qaeda and the Islamic State will see both groups try to outdo each other with attacks in the West,” he said.

 at a cafe in the quiet English city of Gloucester revived a half-century-old puzzle: What happened to Mary Bastholm, a carefree 15-year-old girl who went missing in 1968.
    

            The teenager has long been feared to be among the victims murdered by Fred West, but her body has never been found. 
    

            West and his wife Rosemary, who met the following year, would go on to become Britain’s worst serial killer couple. 
    

            A week-long dig, at the Clean Plate cafe in the heart of the historic city, resulted in the discovery of “
” according to police; but the search has stirred up painful memories. 
    

            More than 25 years have passed since the UK was shocked by the grim discovery of multiple sets of human remains in what had appeared to be a nondescript family home in Gloucester. But too many questions remain unanswered for the public’s fascination with the case to end, or for the city to rest easy.
    

            Fred West was charged with 12 counts of murder, though there have long been suspicions that other young women and girls were abducted, tortured, sexually abused and killed by the Wests. Fred killed himself age 53 before he could stand trial, taking many secrets to his grave. 
    

            Rosemary, known as Rose, was convicted on 10 counts of murder in November 1995; she will remain in prison until she dies. She has always protested her innocence and has revealed nothing about the case over the years.
    

            Adding to the horror is that those killed include family members: Charmaine West, Fred’s 8-year-old stepdaughter from his first marriage to Catherine “Rena” Costello, and Heather West, 16, his eldest child with Rosemary.
    

            It was Heather’s death in 1987 – believed to be the final murder carried out by the pair – that was to lead police to uncovering the mutilated remains of victims at four different sites in the following decade.
    

            What many still wonder is how the killers got away with it for so long.
    

            Most of the couple’s victims were killed in the 1970s. But it was only in August 1992, when the Wests’ five remaining children were taken into local authority care because of child abuse allegations against their parents, that “the whole dreadful, murky business started to unravel,” Leo Goatley, a Gloucester-based solicitor who represented Rose West from 1992 until 2004, told CNN.
    

            It was a history “that went back over decades and involved the abduction, sado-masochistic torture and binding of innocent young women, who were then murdered and dismembered and their bodies buried,” said Goatley, author of the book “Understanding Fred and Rose West: Noose, Lamella and the Gilded Cage.”
    

            “It had and continues to have an enormous impact on the people of Gloucester. It’s a cloud over the ancient city.”
    

            Heather West had last been seen on June 19, 1987, but she was never reported missing to police. Over the course of months, social workers caring for her five siblings began to take note of their repeated – though reportedly offhand – mentions of the “family joke” that their sister was buried under the patio. In summer 1993, the police were told of these concerns.
    

            Six months later – having found no trace of Heather alive – officers from the Gloucestershire Constabulary obtained a warrant to search 25 Cromwell Street, the Wests’ family home since 1972.
    

            Fred West at first claimed he had seen Heather recently. But a day later, on February 25, 1994, he admitted to killing her, according to a 
 of events. He and Rose were arrested the same day.
    

            As police questioning continued – with Fred repeatedly changing his story and Rose denying any knowledge – investigators uncovered a femur in the garden. When a pathologist then found two more femurs under the patio, later identified as belonging to Heather, police knew they could have multiple murders on their hands.
    

            Fred confessed on February 26 to killing two more women, one named Shirley Robinson, 18, and another subsequently identified by police as Alison Chambers, 16. The remains of both were later found in the garden.
    

            On March 4, West passed a handwritten note to his solicitor saying: “I wish to admit to a further (approx) nine killings expressly Charmaine, Rena, Lynda Gough and others to be identified.”
    

            Within hours, West had been taken back to 25 Cromwell Street by police, where he pointed out spots where more bodies had been concealed. 
    

            Remains later identified as those of Swiss student Therese Siegenthaler, 21, Shirley Hubbard, 15, Lucy Partington, 21, Juanita Mott, 18, and 15-year-old Carole Ann “Caz” Cooper
were subsequently found in the basement of the house. The remains of Lynda Gough, 19, were uncovered in the bathroom area. 
    

            Over the course of 11 fevered days, nine victims had been found in one drab end-of-terrace family home.
    

            And as investigators dug, newspaper reports and live TV broadcasts kept a repulsed but fascinated public abreast of every move.
    

            Journalist Chris Summers, who worked for the Gloucester Citizen newspaper at the time, recalls being tipped off as excavations at Cromwell Street began and poring through old cuttings and local records to find out who lived in the house. Events quickly snowballed.
    

    

            “It was a massive, massive story,” said Summers, who now runs the 
 website from London. “The whole of Fleet Street came down, Sky and BBC TV trucks. Within a couple of weeks there were TV crews from Japan and America, all over the place. Fleet Street was waving their checkbooks around … and getting a lot of people to talk. We were trying to compete as the local paper.”
    

            Criminologist Jane Carter Woodrow, whose book “Rose West: The Making of a Monster” was published in 2012, recalls not wanting to watch on TV as black boxes containing human remains were carried out of the house. But for weeks the story dominated the headlines. 
    

            “I think people have an awful fear, but a kind of a fascination, how could this happen? Who could do this kind of thing? It was just awful,” said Carter Woodrow. “There were lots of missing girls and gradually, one by one, people’s remains were coming out – it was just unbelievable, really.”
    

            Details which emerged later revealed the couple were “sexually sadistic” killers, Carter Woodrow told CNN.
    

            The bodies were found dismembered, stuffed into vertical holes in the ground and with “trophy” parts – such as kneecaps and finger bones – removed which have never been found.
    

            Unlike the other victims, Heather was killed because she posed a threat, Carter Woodrow said. She’d started to talk to friends about Fred’s sexual abuse of some of his children and had announced plans to run away.
    

            The search at 25 Cromwell Street was to last for 55 days; the property was subsequently demolished.
    

            In late April of 1994, the focus shifted to nearby 25 Midland Road, where Fred and Rose had lived in the early 1970s with Charmaine and Anne Marie, Fred’s daughter with Costello. Both children had been in and out of local authority care in the late 1960s before being returned to Fred. 
    

            On May 4, police found the remains of Charmaine beneath the kitchen. Rosemary had murdered the 8-year-old in June 1971 while Fred was in prison for theft; on his release, he helped her conceal the body. Charmaine was never reported missing.
    

            Fred had also led police 17 miles or so out of the city to a field in the village of Kempley – near his birthplace of Much Marcle – where Costello’s remains were found in April. The remains of West’s former nanny and pregnant mistress, Ann McFall, were recovered in June from a field nearby. Despite denying involvement in her death, Fred indicated the area where she was buried. 
    

            Since then, no remains have been found. But both Carter Woodrow and Goatley believe there are more bodies out there.
    

            “The experts, the forensic psychologists, believe that the pair of them, Fred and Rose West, would have continued rather than to have big gaps between one (victim) and another,” Goatley said.
    

            When Fred was found dead in his remand cell on January 1, 1995, reaction in Gloucester was mixed, according to Summers. While some felt relief because “they wanted this shameful person wiped off the face of the earth,” others – particularly the victims’ relatives – felt they’d been cheated of justice, he said.
    

            “It was felt that he did it in an attempt to get Rose off. He thought that if he could kill himself … she could then pin it all on him. Obviously that didn’t work,” Summers said. 
    

            Ten months later, Rosemary stood trial at Winchester Crown Court on 10 counts of murder. 
    

            The trial was “pretty dramatic” the whole way through, in Summers’ recollection. One woman who was a neighbor of the Wests and had been in a relationship with Rose told the court that she kept going back to 25 Cromwell Street because she was drawn “like a moth to a flame,” Summers said.
    

            An audio recording was played in court of the police interview in which Fred described how his daughter Heather was killed, dismembered and buried in the garden. “It was just bizarre,” said Summers. “He was very, very matter-of-fact. He could have been talking about burying a dead hamster.”
    

            Rose gave no outward reaction as the guilty verdict was delivered, said Summers. “I think she probably knew what was coming.”
    

            She lost her appeal against the conviction in 1996 and, the following year, her life sentence was converted to a “whole-life” tariff.
    

            Despite the trial, the public was left with many unanswered questions – about both the Wests’ victims and whether public bodies had missed opportunities to halt the appalling cycle of abuse, incest and murder years earlier.
    

            A report 
 into how its agencies served the West children, published in 1995, highlighted the need for teachers, doctors, social workers and police “not to dismiss lightly the comments of children (however apparently bizarre),” and for different bodies to communicate. But at least one newspaper described it as 
.
    

            The murders also highlighted how many young women and girls had gone missing in previous decades. Overall, 110 missing people were found to be safe and well as a result of the West inquiry, according to Gloucestershire Constabulary.
    

            Some of those killed by the Wests came from vulnerable backgrounds. The couple targeted local children’s homes in search of girls to entice to 25 Cromwell Street, according to Carter Woodrow. Others are believed to have been abducted while waiting at bus stops or as they hitchhiked between towns.
    

            Even when they were reported missing, inquiries soon ran out of steam.
    

            “A lot of the victims were in care or had absconded or run away from home, and they were victims that disappeared. They were anonymous, and no one knew they were missing,” said Goatley.
    

            “It’s one of the horrible things about the case that there are so many question marks, so much unknown,” he added.
    

            “Even in the West case, in the trial, where identities were established, it was never entirely clear what fate befell those women and those young girls. It’s known that they were abducted, it’s known that the quality of their lives in their last days would have been appalling … It’s a nightmare trying to speculate about precisely what did happen to those girls.”
    

            Police would have carried on investigating after the West inquiry formally concluded in 1996 but for a lack of resources, said Goatley. “There hadn’t been any fresh evidence, so they had to draw a line somewhere.”
    

            Carter Woodrow believes the Wests’ actions went undetected for so long in part because “they looked like a very ordinary couple” – but that their depraved actions had roots in their childhoods. 
    

            “They’d both been subjected to incest, and they both had abused as well, so when they both met it was the worst possible combination,” she said. 
    

            “There’s no doubt Fred West was a sadist and a voyeur, and a serial killer, a psychopath with a very warped sexual mind. And Rose West was his willing apprentice,” said Goatley. 
    

            “She had this Jekyll and Hyde personality. She could vent a fury that was absolutely appalling, I mean her children can vouch for that. Her vile anger may have even surpassed the level of sadistic action by Fred West in relation to these victims. So it was a really toxic, horrible cocktail.”
    

            As her legal representative, Goatley spent hundreds of hours with Rose between 1992 and 2004, including on prison visits. 
    

            Rose “presents [as] and in many ways is just very ordinary,” he said. “She would chat away about sewing or whatever, talk about the kids and it’s all very mundane and twee and having a laugh.” But Goatley said he saw flashes of anger if the conversation strayed into more difficult territory.
    

            He still hopes Rose, now 67, might one day break her silence. “I’m sure that, one way or another, she knows an awful lot more than she’s letting on. You just hope that she might reach some state of mind where she might give an explanation or an admission, or provide some information,” he said.
    

            Meanwhile, the case has cast a long shadow over Gloucester and its roughly 120,000 residents.
    

            Before the West story broke in 1994, it was a “bit of a forgotten town,” said Summers, ignored by tourists in favor of nearby well-heeled Cheltenham. “Obviously it became part of this kind of morbid tourist trail when the murders happened.”
    

            Even today, it sometimes seems the West case has left hardly anyone in the city untouched, said Goatley. “There’s always somebody who has some story or link or knowledge about the West case … The way it kind of radiates out is extraordinary. It’s almost as though the case envelops a sizable percentage of the population of Gloucester in some way – and emotionally it does, emotionally I think it grabs everyone.”
    

            The unresolved questions over Mary Bastholm’s disappearance mean there is still no peace for her family and those who knew her. 
    

            Her parents and more recently her brother, Peter, went to their grave without knowing her fate. The teenager’s wider family are still without closure now police are certain she wasn’t buried beneath the cafe where she once worked.
    

            “Everyone working on this is disappointed that we didn’t find Mary,” said Assistant Chief Constable Craig Holden on Thursday. “Allowing her family to finally lay Mary to rest after over 50 years was always the most important reason for our excavation.”

            A high-volume 
 that temporarily blocked access to the websites of 
 defense agencies and banks on Tuesday was “the largest [such attack] in the history of Ukraine,” according to a government minister.
    

            Speaking at a press conference Wednesday, Ukrainian Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine Mykhailo Fedorov added that it is too early to tell who was responsible for the attack.
    

            The so-called distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack – which bombarded Ukrainian websites with phony traffic – was coordinated and well planned, officials said. 
    

            DDoS attacks often disrupt access to IT systems, but their impact can be more psychological rather than having any direct effect on a country’s critical infrastructure.
    

            While down for parts of Tuesday, the websites of Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces, and those of two prominent banks, were back up Wednesday, according to CNN journalists in Ukraine. The DDoS attack, however, is ongoing, Ukrainian officials said.
    

            The incident comes as Russia has massed an estimated 150,000 troops close to Ukraine’s border, according to US President Joe Biden, and as US officials warn that a fresh Russian invasion could come at any time. Russia has denied it is planning to invade Ukraine.
    

            The US government is investigating the cyberattack on Ukrainian websites, a top State Department official said Wednesday, while suggesting that Russia has a history of carrying out such hacks.
    

      
      

      

    

            “But who is best at this, who uses this weapon all around the world? Obviously, the Kremlin,” Undersecretary of State Toria Nuland said on CBS This Morning.
    

            “While we’re still investigating and doing forensics along with the Ukrainians, I think what’s most important is that these cyberattacks were not very successful,” Nuland said. She credited Ukrainian officials for responding quickly and helping the websites recover. 
    

            Internet traffic hitting Ukrainian websites during the DDoS attack was “three orders of magnitude more than regularly observed traffic,” according to data collected by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. 
    

            Ninety-nine percent of the traffic involved a type of digital request to computer servers, “indicating the attackers were attempting to overwhelm Ukrainian servers,” said Adam Meyers, CrowdStrike’s senior vice president of intelligence.
    

            A Ukrainian intelligence report recently obtained by CNN pointed to Russia’s effort to destabilize “Ukraine’s internal situation by using economic, energy, information, cyber, social, ethnic, and other tools.”
    

      
      

      

    

            Ukraine has concluded that Russia and Belarus were responsible for a separate cyberattack that hit government websites last month. 
    

            “As a result of a massive hacker attack on the night of January 14, 2022, the web pages of the Government of Ukraine” were shut down. The attacks were carried out by a group affiliated with the Russian and Belarusian special services,” the Ukrainian intelligence report said.
    

            Similarities in the infrastructure used in Tuesday’s DDoS attack and the one last month suggest the incidents could be connected, Ukrainian officials said Wednesday.
    

            In mid-January scores of Ukrainian government websites were targeted in a cyberattack with threatening text warning Ukrainians to “be afraid and wait for the worst,” and alleging their personal information had been hacked.
    

            Ukraine claimed Russia was most likely behind the attack, which affected the websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a number of other government agencies.

2017-08-15 13:43:00+00:00,,"Mouratoglou has been Williams' coach for five years
Williams has won 10 grand slams with Frenchman

            Patrick Mouratoglou likes stress. He craves it. The man Serena Williams credits for taking her from “great to history” is not one to rest. He can’t. Boredom would quickly smother the Frenchman were he to ever take it easy. 
    

            The 47-year-old’s pulse used to quicken when he would watch Williams, one of history’s greatest champions, compete. That was pressure. That was adrenaline. He loved it.
    

            But with his pupil on maternity leave, deep into her third trimester, the coach has to now find the buzz, the rush, from elsewhere, though nothing can truly compare to helping Williams rewrite the record books. 
    

            Even live television interviews do not make the heart race, for the Parisian is as comfortable on screen as the rest of us would be sunbathing on a beach.
    

            “You can check my pulse before and after, I am the same,” he says, fresh from a live appearance on a British breakfast television programme. 
    

            “I find a way to have stress because I need it. I did TV during the French Open and I told the guy ‘make me do things I’ve never done before.’”
    

            This summer marks his fifth as Williams’ coach and so, naturally, he has become accustomed to the attention that comes with working alongside the world’s most recognizable female athlete, a player who has danced in a Beyonce music video and been a tennis superstar for almost two decades.
    

            Once describing being afraid as a “disaster,” Mouratoglou also has no fear, which was a useful trait when confronted by Williams’ father, Richard, shortly after the 23-time grand slam champion had appointed the Frenchman as her coach. 
    

            Never before had the American worked with someone not sanctioned by her family. The father, the engineer behind Serena and sister Venus’ success, needed to be swayed. He was quickly converted and Williams’ decision to broaden her horizons proved to be a masterstroke. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Mouratoglou can list Williams’ achievements since their partnership began as easily as someone ordering takeaway from a favorite restaurant: 10 grand slam titles, two Olympic golds and a three-and-a-half year stint at the top of the world rankings.
    

            But both he and Williams, he says, are the same characters they were before their alliance. 
    

            “I don’t think she’s changed me or I’ve changed her,” Mouratoglou, who describes himself as a person of extremes, tells CNN. 
    

            “I have more exposure clearly than before, but it’s also deserved because we did so well.
    

            “When you’re with Serena you have a lot of exposure, people look at you different, probably. I’m not saying that they should, but it’s a normal process.”
    

            

    

            

    

            

    

            It is just before midday on a glorious London summer’s day and Mouratoglou has already been interviewed 15 times in the last 24 hours, a number that will only increase in the hours ahead as he promotes his autobiography “The Coach,” which is now available in English. 
    

            He has had little sleep. His lack of shut-eye, he says, is a combination of boundless media commitments and late-night socializing with friends in England’s capital.
    

            He gladly accepts a cup of so-so office-made coffee, although outwardly he doesn’t appear to need an injection of caffeine. Wearing a jacket, white shirt and a pocket square, he is the personification of exemplary Gallic tailoring. 
    

            And though 30 minutes early for the interview, he doesn’t use the spare time to pause. Instead, the loquacious Frenchman is happy to talk at length about Williams – her pregnancy, her return – and his rise from an anxious, unhappy child to one of tennis’ best coaches. 
    

            This is a strange time for the father-of-four. He is at Wimbledon with no student to teach, but this summer, he says, is just the interval before one of the sport’s most successful partnerships resumes next year. 
    

            Mouratoglou did not know Williams was pregnant during the Australian Open in January, a tournament she won without dropping a set, but the news did not come as a surprise because the player had, he says, been looking forward to becoming a mother “for quite a long time.”
    

            Ever since Williams announced in May that she was pregnant, the 35-year-old –  the oldest player to ever be a world No.1, the most relentless accumulator of grand slam titles in nearly 50 years – has maintained she will play tennis competitively again.
    

            She is a woman who thinks “everything is possible,” says Mouratoglou. 
    

            “Serena with a baby is still Serena,” he continues. “I know she will need time because I know it’s a trauma for the body, but we’ll take the time. 
    

            “It’s a new situation but when I see how determined she is at the moment to come back, I’d be really surprised if she changed her mind.”
    

      
      

      

    

            By posting videos on social media of practice sessions at her Miami home, the mum-to-be has been showing the world her steadfast desire to make a comeback and last month flew to Paris to make plans with Mouratoglou for her return. 
    

            “She wanted to ask me a lot of things – what would be the team and when we would start,” Mouratoglou explains.
    

            “My job is called adaptation. It’s always about adapting to new situations, but the core team is going to be the same. It’s just extra people, like a nanny, but even if they come to the court, it’s fine, we’ll adapt.
    

            “She’s incredibly happy and she’s frustrated at the same time because she wants to compete. 
    

            “She’s playing every day. She doesn’t move around the court, she just wants to keep contact with the ball and that’s it.”
    

            It was Williams who, in 2012, picked up the phone and called Mouratoglou to ask if she could use the facilities at his academy on the outskirts of France’s capital. He has recently opened another academy in Nice. 
    

            Williams had just suffered a surprise first-round defeat at the French Open and two years had passed since she had won a grand slam title. Confidence was low. 
    

            Mouratoglou’s strategy was to shift this once-in-a-generation talent’s focus onto records, onto building a legacy.
    

            He introduced top spin to her forehand, made her play longer rallies and made sure his charge was mentally prepared for games, formulating tactics for each opponent, using his words carefully to inspire. 
    

            “It’s the little differences,” he says. “When players think right it makes a huge difference and, with champions, it’s even bigger. She can completely switch from one second to another.”
    

      
      

      

    

            The girl from Compton kept going, even though she was already at an age where many retire, and is now one short of equaling Margaret Court’s all-time singles record of 24 grand slams. She is a sporting icon. But what makes Williams a great champion, Mouratoglou explains, is her state of “permanent non-satisfaction.” 
    

            Victories are forgotten, new goals are quickly set. She works as hard to maintain her greatness as she did to achieve it and, crucially, refuses to accept defeat. This is a player who has won three of her grand slam singles titles after being match point down. 
    

            Mouratolgou remembers Williams’ victory at the French Open final in 2013, a tournament she had not won for 11 years. 
    

            “After the trophy ceremony she looks at me and says ‘I want to win Wimbledon,’” he recalls, still impressed by her grit. 
    

            “There was zero celebration and, believe me, we tried. We were in the car and she just said ‘drive me home.’”
    

            Mouratoglou is the son of a Greek-born businessman, but despite his family’s wealth he remembers his childhood as one of being “paralyzed by the shame of not being able to do better.”
    

            An anxious, shy, “puny” kid, his early years were a “disaster,” which makes his evolution into an exceptional communicator all the more remarkable. 
    

            “I couldn’t connect with people so I developed other senses. I had no other option,” says Mouratolgou, who grew from an academic under-achiever into a talented singer and jazz guitarist, though tennis was his passion. 
    

            “I had to make those changes in order to live the life I wanted to live. Now, from my point of view, I have the ideal life.”
    

            How long will that life involve coaching Williams not even he knows. 
    

            “One day she will wake up and she will tell me ‘I don’t feel like going to practice tomorrow.’ She’ll say the same the day after, the week after, and then she’ll tell me it’s game over, but when that is going to be I have no idea,” he says.
    

            What Mouratoglu is sure of, however, is that Williams will be aiming to win grand slams when she returns to the sport. 
    

            “The goal is not to beat this record, or that record, the real goal is to set up Serena’s record. Is it 23? 24? 25? 30? I don’t know, but let’s go, let’s find out.
    

            “Why would there be a limit? If, as a coach, I set limits for Serena I’m really a terrible coach because Serena doesn’t have limits.”
    

            

    

            She might not have played since the Australian Open final, but Williams is still making headlines.
    

            First her pregnancy caused waves, then she appeared naked on the front cover of Vanity Fair, and recently she’s been involved in a spat with compatriot John McEnroe. 
    

            The three-time Wimbledon champion said Williams would be “about 700 in the world” were she on the men’s tour. While others debated the matter, Williams responded on social media, asking the former world No.1 to respect her privacy.
    

      
      

      

    

            There has not been an interview where Mouratoglou has not been asked about the outspoken New Yorker’s comments.
    

            “He didn’t mean to hurt her, of course, but it’s hurtful and I understand her reaction,” he says. “It’s basically saying women’s tennis is not good. But one comment does not make a sport sexist.”
    

            At pain to emphasize he is not specifically referring to McEnroe, Mouratoglou, who has also coached on the men’s tour, criticizes those who habitually compare men’s and women’s tennis. 
    

            “It’s true women don’t run as fast, they don’t jump as high but because of that does it make their tour not interesting? I don’t think so, it’s just another tour,” he says. 
    

            

    

            “You have to see women’s and men’s tennis as different sports because women have different qualities. I don’t understand why people compare, it doesn’t make sense to me. 
    

            “The message is – it’s not as good as men. OK, if you don’t like it, don’t watch it. You don’t have to make a comment. Let the people who like it, like it.”

            It added: “The FFF would like to salute the remarkable sporting and economic results of Noël Le Graët.”
    

            FFF vice president Philippe Diallo has been announced as the interim president until June 10, 2023, the date of the next federation meeting.
    

            Le Graët has been president of the FFF since 2011 and his mandate was due to run until 2024.
    

            Last month, the 81-year-old chose to step down from his role as president “until the completion of the audit performed by the sports ministry.”
    

            According to 
, the audit said that Le Graët had displayed “inappropriate behaviour … towards women” and that he no longer had the “necessary legitimacy” to work in French sport. 
    

            Le Graët has denied any wrongdoing, Reuters reported. CNN has contacted his lawyers and the FFF for further comment. 
    

            Last month, Le Graët also drew the ire of players and politicians for comments about French legend Zinedine Zidane.
    

            In an interview with radio station RMC in January, Le Graët said he “wouldn’t even have taken [a] call” from Zidane when asked whether the World Cup winner had called to express an interest in taking over as the men’s national team coach from Didier Deschamps.
    

            He later 
 for the remarks.
    

            Le Graët has been credited with reviving the French team having been in charge of the FFF when Les Bleus won the World Cup in 2018 and lost in the final against Argentina last year.
    

            But he also has a record of making controversial comments, 
 in 2019 that he is “totally against” the interruption of football matches as a result of homophobic chants and banners.
    

            “I would not stop the games. I do not want to be held hostage on homophobia. There are security services to ensure that these banners disappear,” Le Graët told radio station France Info at the time.

            I’ve always said this year has kind of been, really, the year of the quarterbacks. Drew Brees becoming the all-time leading passer, Tom Brady’s still doing his thing at the age of 41. But I kind of see the young guns, the young quarterbacks that are rising.
    

            My Steelers won Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, but the following season we ended up missing the playoffs despite winning the last three games, finishing 9-7 and not losing a single game by more than six points. It’s a letdown because you know you still have the talent in place and the ingredients to find success. But on the flip side, you realize what a blessing it is to get a chance in the first place. 
    

            I’ve played with guys who never even came close to making the playoffs. 
    

            Playing in the playoffs and really making that push towards a Super Bowl is really what we live for as football players. It’s what we get paid for and, honestly, I know a lot of people that would do it for free. That’s what you dreamed about when you were a little kid, because there’s nothing like playing in the Super Bowl. 
    

            It was hard for us, because when you’re in those last few weeks, you want to control your own destiny. You don’t want to have to worry about needing help to get into the playoffs, hoping other teams lose and worrying about whether other teams are going to end up resting players because they have their spot already locked up. It’s hard to not take a peek up at that scoreboard while you’re playing and see what else is going on. 
    

            You can kind of see the similarities with the Eagles this year. They still have a lot of their key pieces from their Super Bowl run and win, but they’ve been struggling to keep things consistent. They’ve got a sense of urgency because they know the temperature is getting hotter, especially because they know they have to win out and still get a little bit of help along the way. 
    

            They’re still a good team, just like we were still a good team in 2009-10 (we ended up making the Super Bowl that next year). For the Eagles to have been able to beat the Rams last week, that’s impressive, especially on the road. When it comes to Nick Foles, the guy’s just been able to get it done in Philly. The team rallies around him, so we’ll see if he’s able to pull off some of the same magic as last year. 
    

            That’s the fun and uniqueness of making a playoff push. Teams that control their own destiny, kudos to them for getting it done. And if you’re one of those teams where your season is going to come down to the last weekend, it makes for an exciting ride. 
    

            
 It seems like they’re on the verge of getting over the hump and they’ve got plenty of young talent around them. They’ve already won more games this season than they have in the last three years. 
    

            
There was so much pressure on him, from being a Heisman winner to being the top pick, to Cleveland having looked for a quarterback for so long. I love what he brings to the table. I love that he’s – I wouldn’t say cocky, but confident. You want a quarterback who has that moxie, because when you’re in the huddle, everybody else builds off that.

            The McLaren driver 
on the advice of his doctors but will drive in Sunday’s race if he passes a medical assessment by the sport’s governing body, the FIA, at the Sepang circuit on Thursday.

            Alonso was 
after losing control of his McLaren at the penultimate winter test at Barcelona’s Circuit de Catalunya on February 22.
    

            The 33-year-old watched the Melbourne race from his home in Dubai after doctors indicated returning to racing three weeks after a high impact crash was too risky.
    

            McLaren said senior engineers discussed the accident with Alonso when he visited the team’s headquarters outside London last week. 
    

            The team said in a statement: “While there was nothing evident in the extensive car telemetry data, nor anything abnormal in the subsequent reconstructions and laboratory tests, Fernando recalls a sense of ‘heavy’ steering prior to the accident.”
    
Sir Jackie Stewart has been in the spotlight for 
 today 

            Stewart believes Alonso and his team made the right decision not to race in Australia, even though it meant delaying the star driver’s return to the McLaren cockpit after five years with Ferrari.
    

            “I don’t have any doubt at all that his doctors did exactly the right thing and that he had made the right decision personally to follow the instructions of their medical team,” Sir Jackie told CNN. “I look forward to see him back in the cockpit.”
    

            Williams driver Valtteri Bottas is also facing an FIA medical Thursday after he was unable to take part in the Melbourne race following a back injury sustained during qualifying.
    

            “After such a frustrating Sunday in Australia, I have taken the necessary measures to make sure I arrive in Malaysia fit to race and ready to bring the results home,” said the in-form Finnish driver.
    

      
      

      

    

            Stewart says it is important that F1 continues to protect its drivers, even if it means insisting they sit out races.
    

            The most serious accident in recent times has left Marussia racer 
 and fighting serious head injuries following a crash in wet conditions at the Japanese Grand Prix last October.
    

            “We shouldn’t take it for granted that drivers are bulletproof,” warned Sir Jackie, who raced in an era of frequent fatalities in the 1960s and 1970s.
    

            “Motor racing is still dangerous. People are surviving accidents but you are this far from death sometimes. 
    

            “You’ve got to recognize that and you cannot be irresponsible. Liberties are being taken today that I prefer are not taken. You can always improve safety.”

            Duran Duran lead singer Simon Le Bon was at the height of his fame in 1985 when his life was turned upside down.
    

            Le Bon, front man of iconic 1980s British pop band, was competing in the Fastnet yacht race – a 608-mile round trip between the Isle of Wight and Plymouth off Britain’s southwest coast.
    

            He was asleep aboard his 78-foot maxi-yacht Drum when the keel broke off the hull due to a design failure.
    

            The boat capsized, trapping Le Bon and five other crew members inside. Although the alarm was raised straight away by another yacht, Carat, the men were stuck inside the upturned yacht for 40 minutes until they were rescued.
    

            The incident had a profound impact on Le Bon, one of the biggest popstars of the 1980s who just one month before had performed to a worldwide television audience of 1.5 billion as part of Live Aid.
    

            “It really did frighten me,” Le Bon told CNN Sport in an interview at last month’s Southampton Boat Show.
    

            “It’s something you don’t realize until after the event,” said Le Bon, an avid sailor since his youth, with one of the pop group’s early hits – “Rio” – featuring the band members on a yacht in Antigua in the accompanying video.
    

            “About two or three days after it happened, I broke out into this rash, all over my chest, and all over my arms. I am sure it was a stress-related thing. I just couldn’t sleep, because I was asleep when the keel went,” he said, reflecting on the 1985 capsize.
    

            In 2016, Le Bon watched footage of his dramatic rescue, near Falmouth in Cornwall, by the Royal National Lifeboat Institute and a helicopter from the 771 Royal Naval Air Squadron, for the first time as part of a BBC documentary.  
    

            “I had to go down to come up,” he told the BBC. “I dived in and started going up – as I came up the waistband of my long johns got caught and pulled down.”
    

            “As I came up to the surface I stopped about two feet away. I wanted to breathe but if I did I knew that would be the end of me. 
    

            “I managed to get them off my feet and came up with a big smile on my face.
    

            “I got winched off into the helicopter and one of the guys called ‘Hey Simon, where’s your pants?’ because I was just stood there in my knickers.”
    

            Television footage showed the singer back on shore with bare legs. 
    

            “There’s me … a rock star in his underpants,” Le Bon told the BBC.
    

            

    

            

    

            Although Le Bon had entered Drum in the Fastnet as a test event for the 1985-1986 Whitbread Round the World race, he had second thoughts about taking part in the circumnavigation.
    

            A phone call from his experienced American skipper, Skip Novak, three weeks after the capsize changed his mind.
    

            “He said ‘Hey Simon … we’re going to fix her up. And the Whitbread people have agreed to delay the start of the race a whole month so that we can enter,’” Le Bon said in Southampton.
    

            “And I said ‘Skip, I don’t think I can do it. It just terrified me, and I am still suffering.’ And he went: ‘Simon, England expects!’ And I thought, ‘Oh, OK, OK.’” 
    

            

    

            The first few days back on board weren’t easy.
    

            “It was tough, and I remember the first night on the boat that I spent after that, I was rigid,” Le Bon said. “I was like a bow, with my head on the pillow, and my feet on the bed and air between the rest of me and mattress, I was terrified that first night.
    

            “But the second night wasn’t as bad, and the third night was almost OK, and the fourth night, I went to sleep and had a good time, and I woke up in the morning and I thought ‘I’m at sea, and it’s wonderful.’”
    

            Drum would eventually finish third in elapsed time in the Whitbread, which has since changed its name to the Volvo Ocean Race. 
    

            The story of Le Bon’s dramatic rescue created headlines around the world, and more than 10,000 spectator boats welcomed Drum back to British shores. 
    

            When asked if the experience had been life-changing, Le Bon said: “Yes, it was. But we all have life-changing experiences. It was a particularly well-publicized one. That’s the big difference. People trip over a curb and it could be life-changing. These things happen. It’s just part of being human, we all go through these things.”
    

            The capsize also had a big impact on Novak, an expert in polar sailing who would compete in four Whitbread Round the World races.
    

            “There is something singular about having shared a life-threatening experience, the day we found ourselves upside-down in the English Channel,” Novak wrote in a column for Yachting World in 2016. 
    

            “The refit against all the odds strengthened that bond and stood us in good stead for the protracted challenge of the Whitbread race itself, which was no mere outing. It was not the accomplishment that mattered most, but rather the total experience.”  
    

            Le Bon, a father-of-three who turns 60 at the end of October, still performs with Duran Duran. Although he sold Drum in 1988 to Scottish businessman Arnold Clark, he also still sails regularly in regattas and owns a wooden motor boat that’s moored in Italy. 
    

            Le Bon, who recently became a grandfather with his wife, Yasmin, has been a long-serving ambassador of The Blue Marine Foundation (BLUE), which aims to combat the effects of over-fishing and the destruction of biodiversity on the world’s oceans by creating large marine reserves.
    
Pandemonium as Simon Le Bon (Millennials: thats lead singer of Duran Duran), opens 
 

            He is hugely concerned about the future of the world’s oceans.
    

            “As a recreational boater and a swimmer, I want to go down into an undersea park when I put my snorkle and mask on,” he said.
    

            “I want to see fish, I want to see lots of different life, I don’t want to see a dead, gray sea floor, which in the Mediterranean, is really what you’ve got right now. And that’s going to take a lot of work.”

Sweden to implement temporary border controls 
At least 18 died Wednesday in two boat accidents off Turkey

            As Europe faces its worst refugee crisis since World War II, the European Union has launched an emergency fund for Africa to tackle the spiraling number of migrants flooding its shores.
    

            The nearly $2 billion fund was unveiled at the end of a two-day summit of EU and African leaders in Malta. The fund will support projects to combat poverty, slow down migration and speed up repatriation programs. This new money is in addition to the 20 billion euros annually donated to Africa by the EU and its 28 states.
    

            This is the sixth time that presidents and prime ministers of the European Union have tried to tackle the issue.
    

            “We are under no illusions that we can improve the situation overnight, but we are committed to giving people alternatives to risking their lives,” said European Council President Donald Tusk.
    

            Tusk listed five major goals to stem the tide of migrants: “The elements of action plan are designed to, one, address the root causes of migration; two, enhance cooperation on legal migration and mobility; three, reinforce protection of displaced persons; four, prevent and fight against migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings; and five, advance on returning persons that are not entitled to stay in Europe.” 
    

            Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said that while some may argue that the fund was not enough, he stressed it was an important first step. 
    

            The Mediterranean island nation of Malta is the smallest member of the European Union. About 90 kilometers (56 miles) south of Sicily, it has become one of the destinations for those fleeing Syria’s bloody civil war. 
    

            “I for one am a very vocal critic of the fact that we maybe started acting a little bit too late when too many lives were lost at sea,” Muscat said, adding that he hoped the summit “sowed the seeds of something that can be much more long term.” 
    

            European Council President Tusk also confirmed plans for a summit with Turkey by the end of this year, seen as the key to resolving the crisis. 
    

            After an informal meeting of EU heads after the summit, Tusk said “the clock is ticking. We are under pressure. We need to act fast. As a union. And in cooperation with our partners, including Turkey, that also will have to move fast. 
    

            “But Turkey cannot be our only partner. We must not lose sight of Jordan and Lebanon, nor of the countries of the Western Balkans. They are also our allies.”
    

            Even as Europe tries to forge a unified response to the crisis, tens of thousands continue to embark on perilous journeys, desperate to escape the repression, violence, poverty and insecurity in North Africa, West Africa and the Middle East.
    

            They come from more than 20 nations and with different motivations. 

    

            Many die in their attempt to find a safe haven.
    

            On Wednesday, hours before the EU meeting was scheduled to convene, at least 18 people died off the western coast of Turkey in two boat incidents. 
    

            Mountains of life jackets piled up on the beaches of the Greek island of Lesbos offer a startling testimony to the scale of the problem.
    

            The EU border agency Frontex, which tracks the movement of people, says 540,000 migrants arrived on Greek islands in the first 10 months of 2015. This figure is 13 times higher than in the same period of 2014. 
    

            Syrians account for the largest number of arrivals, according to the Frontex website. In recent weeks, the share of Afghan nationals has risen significantly.
    

            Frontex has called for more than 250 officers to help screen, fingerprint and register migrants.
    

            Meanwhile, Sweden has joined the list of countries that have tightened border controls.
    

            The Ministry of Home Affairs said it will implement temporary border controls for 10 days, and they could be extended to 20 days at some point, according to Fredrik Persson, a spokesman for the ministry.
    

            Sweden’s Prime Minister Stefan Löfven defended the move, telling CNN: “This is not closing the border, the decision we have taken is to reintroduce internal border controls … if a person comes to our country seeking asylum he or she will be given that opportunity.”

            A far-right party is exerting its political influence in the Spanish capital of Madrid, starting with its Christmas lights. 
    

            Vox made a pact with the conservative Partido Popular (PP), which rules the city’s regional government, earlier this year. And the far-right party, a newcomer on Spain’s political scene, has already made its presence felt.
    

            It has seized on cultural issues, and last month secured commitments to increase spending and religious imagery on Christmas decorations around Madrid. Vox has also opposed attempts to improve gender equality and pushed for a new family department to promote what it describes as traditional values.
    

            Each of these policies touches on key issues for Vox, which won four out of 57 seats in May’s Madrid council elections. It then entered negotiations with the PP over policy concessions in exchange for support in crucial council votes. The PP formed the city government in August.
    

            Vox burst onto the political scene in 2018 after taking an unexpectedly high number of seats in the election in Andalusia, Spain’s largest region. Not only did
the result accord the party influence through its crucial support for a PP-led alliance, it also marked something of a watershed – as the first time a far-right party had entered a regional parliament since the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975.
    

            It then won 24 out of a total 350 seats in the national parliament in April’s general election, a slightly disappointing result for the party after its Andalusian success, according to some political experts, but one which nonetheless cemented its place as a new political force. 
    

            Vox has attracted voters with its hard line stance on illegal immigration, its opposition to Catalan independence and its calls for Gibraltar to be returned to Spain, as well as an emphasis on cultural traditions, which were raised recently in Madrid.
    

            A Vox spokesman told CNN that the previous regional government had removed all religious symbolism from Christmas decorations in the city, but his party wants to reemphasize the Christian tradition of the festival. “We are not telling people how they should celebrate Christmas but from the institutions we should be accurate and respect the Spanish culture, the Catholic culture,” he said.
    

            This year there will be more lights, larger decorations and new designs that focus on traditional Christmas images. Nativity scenes will be installed at several of the city’s symbolic monumental gates.
    

            Festive decorations are just one symbolic issue that Vox has taken up. The party doesn’t control any council departments and officially remains in opposition. But Vox’s pact with PP means Isabel Díaz Ayuso, Madrid’s regional leader, has promised to develop a program with concessions to Vox. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “I’ll honor it completely because that’s my word,” said Ayuso in reference to the pact, which includes provisions forcing schools to inform parents about the content of lessons before the start of term, and changes to the way in which unaccompanied migrant children are identified.
    

            A Vox spokesman told CNN that there have been mistakes in identifying foreign unaccompanied minors and that there have been cases of people pretending to be children in order to claim certain state benefits.
    

            “We demand that a new way of identification is put in place so we can correctly identify the people who have the right to those benefits,” the spokesman said, emphasizing that Vox has zero tolerance for illegal migration. “We would like those benefits to go to legal and regulated immigration.”
    

            A PP spokeswoman told CNN the identification of minors is the responsibility of the central prosecutor’s office for minors, not regional politicians. The spokeswoman emphasized that any policy changes would have to be made at a national level, rather than by the local Madrid government.
    

            Madrid’s PP mayor, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, will need Vox’s votes again to pass a budget and other essential business. 
    

            However Almeida and Vox spokesman Javier Ortega Smith have already suffered a very public disagreement, arguing in the street in full view of the press and the public on September 19. As Almeida and other public figures observed a minute’s silence in honor of a victim of gender-based violence, Ortega Smith disrupted proceedings holding a sign that read: “Violence has no gender.” 
    

            Speaking about the incident, the Vox spokesman expressed his condolences with the family of the victim. “It was just a way of expressing our condolences from another point of view,” he said. “All victims are the same, they shouldn’t be treated differently because of their gender.” 
    

            Almeida said that he thought Vox had made a mistake in bringing the banner to the memorial. However the mayor also emphasized that he “does not believe in gender ideology” and that the struggle for equality between men and women should be “without ideology.” 
    

      
      

      

    

            Despite the public row, Almeida said that there was nothing “uncomfortable” about the arrangement between Vox and the PP. “I don’t see any issues with the relationship with Vox other than some disagreements that can be solved,” he said at a press conference.
    

            However Yolanda Besteiro, president of feminist organization Fundación de Mujeres Progresistas, told CNN that she is worried and saddened by the PP-Vox pact and Almeida’s statements on gender equality. “It’s dangerous,” she said, warning that the PP is legitimizing the far-right. “It’s a setback in the implementation of gender equality policies.”
    

            With a relationship that includes significant concessions to Vox’ policy program, some had worried that the far-right was controlling the Madrid government. However Maria José Canel, professor of political and public sector communication at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, told CNN that the situation is more nuanced. “It (Vox) holds an important position but not as important as it had hoped,” she said. “Vox is not directly imposing conditions on the local government in Madrid.”
    

            The party secured fewer concessions than it had originally asked for from the PP, according to Canel, and has adopted a less controversial approach in the run-up to new national elections on November 10. “I think they’re going to maintain this softer approach until they work out how many votes they can get,” she said.
    

            However, by staying out of government the party has made a strong strategic move, she added. “It is able to keep its hands free to raise objections and make public declarations against (the government),” said Canel, explaining that it would not have been able to do so if it took control of a council department.
    

            As for Vox’s place in the far-right ecosystem, Canel warns against drawing easy comparisons. “The far-right movement in Spain does not fit the same characteristics as far-right movements in other countries,” she said. 
    

            Canel said that Vox is not as “skillful” as other far-right groups, and pointed out that the vast majority of Spanish voters are in favor of the European Union. Other European far-right movements use opposition to the EU as a rallying cry, something that Vox is unable to do. So the party exists in a specific Spanish context which sets it apart from other far-right groups.
    

            Canel also shut down the idea of deep cooperation between Vox and other far-right figures such as Italy’s interior minister Matteo Salvini of the Northern League party, who has himself been advised by US President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, Steve Bannon. “It’s not that simple,” she said.

One Muscovite told her that Russia's connections with rebels meant it was involved

            Outside the Dutch Embassy in Moscow, people have left flowers and cuddly toys at a makeshift memorial for the lives lost in a conflict-scarred corner of eastern Ukraine.
    

            Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 fell from the sky in Donetsk on Thursday, killing all aboard. Of the 298 people killed, 193 – nearly two-thirds – were Dutch citizens.   
    

            The United States accuses Moscow of supporting the pro-Russian rebels that it suspects shot down the aircraft. 
    

            Russia denies involvement, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying Ukraine’s military operation against the rebels is to blame for the tragedy. He has called for a “thorough and objective” investigation.
    

            With rebels in control of the crash area, and reports of bodies and wreckage being tampered with, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters he had a “very intense” conversation with Putin on Saturday.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Rutte said he told Putin “the opportunity expires to show the world that he is serious about helping.”
    

            The tributes at the Dutch Embassy in Moscow include a hand-drawn picture of a plane broken in midair with the caption “children should not die,” in a child’s handwriting.
    

            Another message reads: “We are afraid, we are ashamed, we are in mourning.”  
    

            While the official Russian position is that Russia played no role and has no responsibility for the crash, what’s striking in many of the notes is the use of the phrase “forgive us.”
    

            The messages give a sense that the people who have left them do feel that Russia has an element of responsibility in what is playing out in eastern Ukraine.
    

            One note reads, in English, “Excuse us, please, if you can. Sorry! Russia, Moscow.”
    

            Paying his condolences at the embassy, Muscovite Yuri Yemshanov told CNN it was “difficult to recognize that our country could be involved in this accident.”
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “I think there’s lot of proof that we’re in closer relations and connections with the separatists in Ukraine. I suppose it’s clearly understood that we support them by providing weapons, and so I think it doesn’t matter who launched that rocket. Just because we’re supporting terrorists, we’re involved.” 
    

            His wife, Marina, added: “I think there should be investigation, but of course many things are understood now and we probably could know who did this. Now I think it’s time to say I’m sorry for these people. This is the  first thing.” 
    

            Another woman, who gave her name as Olga, said that she was sure Russia was not involved in the tragedy and that an investigation would establish who was, but she added: “However, I would also say ‘forgive me.’ I’m feeling the same.”
    

            Arnold van Sinderen, a Dutch citizen living in Moscow, told CNN he believed that the West painted the wrong image of Putin, but that all the same, the Russian leader needed to step up.
    

            “It’s time to take responsibilities there and bring peace in this region. He should take his responsibility as well with what is happening with the plane crash; this might accelerate the situation.”
    

            Meantime, the tributes outside the embassy pile up.

            Colonel Ilmars Lejins of the Latvian Armed Forces says he considers Latvia’s enormous Russian neighbor his primary threat.
    

            “Our neighbor to the East has shown his intents and capability of disrespecting international law and treaty obligations,” Lejins says. “So I must consider that in my military planning.”
    

            Tensions in eastern Europe have been ratcheting up ever since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and the US military presence in the region has increased significantly. 
    

            But the election of Donald Trump has thrown the Baltic States, including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (who rely heavily on US protection), into a great deal of uncertainty.  
    

      
      

      

    

            During the campaign, Trump outlined a sharp break in US foreign policy tradition, suggesting the 
 including the Baltic states, against Russian aggression if they haven’t “fulfilled their obligation to us.”
    

            This rhetoric, combined with his public admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, has left 
that a new Cold War with Putin is coming. 
    

            Publicly, officials in Baltic countries are taking a wait-and-see approach. They stress that they have dramatically increased defense expenditures for the next several years while reminding the US that they have contributed troops to US-led military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
    

            Former Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili, who famously fought and lost a war against Russia in 2008, predicts the next several months could be particularly tense. 
    

            “Baltic countries are so vulnerable,” Saakashvili told CNN from Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, where he is forming a local political party. 
    

            “We see that the military potential of these three countries (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) cannot match, in any way, the Russian military. And the problem is: I don’t see large European powers coming to their help.”
    

            

    

            In a snowy field in Latvia, cannons lob artillery shells at distant targets. A pair of Blackhawk helicopters land, and soldiers from the US Army’s 173rd Airborne Brigade pour out, firing a rocket attached to a long cord laced with explosives. It detonates, a simulation of how soldiers would blow a path through a deadly minefield in the event of a conflict. 
    

            US troops are performing military maneuvers with the Latvian military and a platoon of soldiers from Slovenia as part of a series of joint exercises called “Atlantic Resolve.”
    

            “The origins were in response to Russian activity in 2014, when the strategic situation changed,” said Colonel Gregory Anderson, who monitored this exercise with his local counterpart Colonel Lejins. 
    

            Anderson was referring to Russia’s lightning-swift occupation and annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea.
    

            To confuse and then push Ukrainian troops out of the region, Russia deployed so-called “little green men,” well-disciplined Russian forces who wore uniforms without insignia or flags identifying their country of origin.
    

            The well-choreographed operation has served as a wake-up call to the new strength and sophistication of the Russian military. 
    

            

    

            If a conflict suddenly exploded with Russia, Latvian commanders say their forces would present little more than a “speed bump” to an advancing Russian military.
    

            “Therefore, the US presence here is very important to deter Russian attempts or simply to avoid miscalculation,” says Garisons, Latvia’s secretary of state.
    

            Latvian officials say, Russia has amassed two armies with an estimated 200,000 troops on the other side of the border. Five years ago, Russia reestablished a helicopter base with scores of aircraft at a location a short drive from the Latvian border. 
    

      
      

      

    

            To protect itself and its population of nearly two million people, Latvia has only 5,000 professional troops as well as a much larger force of volunteer National Guards.
    

            “We need to be a good speed bump that takes out the muffler of the enemy so that it is loud enough that there is no question that this is military aggression against one NATO member,” Colonel Lejins explains. “Then the activation of (Article 5) occurs.”
    

            Under Article 5 of the NATO charter, an attack on one member is considered an attack on all countries in the alliance and requires an active response.
    

            Next, we drive cross country from Latvia, across Lithuania and into Kaliningrad, an exclave of Russian territory sandwiched between Poland and the Baltics, cut off from mainland Russia.
    

            At the end of World War II, Soviet Red Army soldiers wrenched control of this territory from Nazi Germany. For decades, it was a heavily militarized region, closed off to foreigners.
    

            The region lurched into the headlines last fall after Russia confirmed reports it deployed nuclear-capable Iskender missiles to Kaliningrad.
    

             Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov defended Russia’s right to deploy weapons to its sovereign territory in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour last October. 
    

            “They moved NATO infrastructure next to our borders,” Lavrov said. “And this is not United States territory.”
    

            In many ways, Kaliningrad is a historical curiosity. The streets of the main city, which was known in German times as Konigsberg, are lined with grand examples of old German architecture alongside grim, concrete Soviet apartment blocks. 
    

            Here, some Russians also expressed hope about the next US government. 
    

            “With the change of leadership in the US we are hoping for an improvement in the situation,” says Konstantin Smernov, a 53-year-old former lieutenant in the Soviet Navy who now works as a real estate agent. “Confrontation isn’t good for anybody.”  
    

      
      

      

    

            Western governments imposed economic sanctions on Russia after the seizure of Crimea in 2014. In restaurants and in homes here, many Russians said those measures contributed to a broader economic crisis that set in after the plunge in oil prices in recent years.  Oil and natural gas are two of Russia’s most important exports and the backbone of the country’s economy.
    

            Those sanctions, combined with a move last summer to remove visa-free travel for Kaliningrad residents traveling to neighboring Poland, have some here concerned about the former Soviet citadel’s increasing isolation.
    

            

    

            Anna Shugatova was born after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Her dream was to find a job that would allow her to travel. But the 23-year-old, who moved to Kaliningrad from her home in Siberia to pursue a master’s degree in linguistics, says that dream is now in doubt. 
    

            “I don’t know if I will be able to travel soon. There are tensions between countries,” Shugatova said.
    

            But several Russians say they’ve found one advantage to living in an enclave with relatively easy access to countries like Poland and Lithuania. Visitors can purchase and smuggle in foreign foods that are now banned in Russia. 
    

            “We are back to the days of smuggling cheese and sausage from abroad,” said Igor Pleshkov, a businessman and vocal critic of the Kremlin who describes himself as the sole elected member of the opposition on Kaliningrad’s city council.
    

            The Russian port of Baltiysk, about a 45-minute drive towards the coast, is still very much a militarized garrison town. Warships from the Russian Navy’s Baltic Sea Fleet moor at the town entrance, while rows of olive-green military trucks and armored vehicles can be seen in several nearby compounds. 
    

            One of the striking oddities about this region is the dozens of ruined German churches dotting the countryside. These crumbling places of worship stand partially collapsed and empty, symbols of what happened the last time armies fought for control of this part of Europe.

He also warns against gossip, saying it
is harmful to people and the church's work
This is Francis' first Christmas message to the Roman Curia
Since becoming pope, he has been taking steps to reform the way the Holy See is run

            Pope Francis put the ideals of professionalism, service and holiness to the fore Saturday in his first Christmas message to the Curia, the Roman Catholic Church’s governing body.
    

            The Roman Curia, which includes Vatican staff, priests and cardinals, gathered in the ornate Clementine Hall. The pope praised those who have worked in the Vatican for “many years with immense dedication, hidden from the eyes of the world.”
    

            The church needs “people who work with competence, precision and self sacrifice in the fulfillment of their daily duties,” he said.
    

            Without professionalism, Francis warned, “there is a slow drift downwards towards mediocrity” and “dossiers become full of trite and lifeless information” that fail to inspire.
    

      
      

      

    

            Without an attitude of service to bishops and churches worldwide, he said, “the structure of the Curia turns into a ponderous, bureaucratic customs house, constantly inspecting and questioning, hindering the working of the Holy Spirit and the growth of God’s people.”
    

            Holiness encompasses an openness to God, prayer, deep humility and fraternal charity in relationships with fellow workers, Francis said. 
    

            “It also means apostleship, discreet and faithful pastoral service, zealously carried out in direct contact with God’s people. For priests, this is indispensable,” he said.
    

            He also urged the Curia to avoid indulging in gossip, saying: “Gossip is harmful to people, our work and our surroundings.”
    

            Francis has already taken a number of steps to try to reform the Vatican’s administration in the nine months since he was elected to the papacy.
    

            CNN’s Vatican reporter John Allen, also a senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, said Saturday’s speech was brief but set out some core principles.
    

            “He said very clearly he wants a Vatican that is focused on service, rather than power,” Allen said.
    

            In July, the pope set up an expert committee to recommend reforms to the economic and administrative structures of the Holy See. He has also ordered more scrutiny of the Vatican bank, which has been plagued by financial scandals for years.
    

            Earlier this month, he announced the creation of a commission to prevent the abuse of minors and to support victims of abuse.
    

            The Catholic Church has faced calls for reform in the wake of scandals involving the sexual abuse of children by priests and allegations of corruption.
    

            Since taking charge, Francis has also shifted the tone of the church toward a focus on service, compassion and helping the poor and addressed controversial issues such as homosexuality and the role of women in the church.
    

            At his final general audience of 2013 in St. Peter’s Square on Wednesday, the pope spoke about the birth of Jesus and the importance of humility.
    

            “It is an ugly thing,” he said, “when you see a Christian who doesn’t want to humble himself, who doesn’t want to serve, a Christian who struts about everywhere: it’s ugly, eh? That is not a Christian: that’s a pagan!”
    

            In a measure of the impact he’s already had as pontiff, Francis was named as Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” this month.
    

            The Vatican welcomed Time’s selection, while making it clear the man so widely recognized for his own humility didn’t seek the award and didn’t want its light to shine on him but on the mission of the church.

            As a strategy to deal with any mice in hotel rooms, Victoria’s emergency services minister Lisa Neville recommended not feeding them.
    

            “As I understand there may have been some feeding going on,” Neville

            “Firstly, we moved the particular tennis player the other day. We’ve had the hotel pest control this week and I think there may have been some feeding going on with the mice.”
    

            Putintseva is one of the 72 players and their teams that have been forced to quarantine in their hotel rooms for 14 days after their arrival in Australia ahead of 2021’s first grand slam.
    

            

    

            Without the ability to go out and train ahead of the tournament, players have voiced their frustrations, including record eight-time Australian Open men’s singles winner Novak Djokovic, who put forward a list of proposals that would loosen the restrictions on the quarantining stars, including moving players to houses with courts, better food, and reducing the number of days in isolation.

            The UK must look very weird to the outside world at the moment. 
    

            Don’t worry though: Brexit, 
, has left much of the UK’s population just as confused. 
    

            This week, it looked as though Prime Minister Theresa May’s hard-won yet widely-loathed Brexit deal with the European Union would finally have its moment in the spotlight, as lawmakers were set to vote in the House of Commons on Tuesday. Then, after a weekend of speculation, 

    

            48 hours later, she 
. The result of this vote – win or lose – could fundamentally alter the Brexit timetable and change the entire complexion of UK politics.  
    

      
      

      

    

            One of the most common questions that European politicos are asked by people with better things to do is “what will actually happen with Brexit?” For the last couple of years, it’s been possible to conjure up half answers that sound a bit clever and move on. But the awful truth, even this late in the game, is that no one knows – even the people in charge. 
    

            This partly stems from the current reality of British politics. No one, it seems, has a workable plan that can be credibly presented as something that might, you know, feasibly happen. 
    

            May and her inner circle have failed to convince the UK’s Parliament that her deal really is the best – and only – thing on the table.
    

            As a result, the Prime Minister pulled the so-called meaningful vote on her Brexit deal, presumably for fear of a heavy defeat and the chain of events that could follow.
    

            Should she survive the confidence vote, May will then head back to Brussels in the hope that she get secure sufficient assurances on her deal and sway MPs to vote for it. 
    

            Never let it be said that the Prime Minister is not an optimist…
    

            One of the many problems she faces is that even her own Conservative Party hates the deal, in large part because of something called the Irish border backstop. 
    

            The border between the Republic of Ireland (an EU member state) and Northern Ireland (part of the UK) has been the thorniest issue of the whole Brexit process. For historical reasons, both negotiating teams have from day one said that avoiding a hard border was an absolute priority. 
    

            Unfortunately, for boring reasons to do with trade and customs, that is likely impossible unless Northern Ireland is in some kind of Customs Union with the EU, which means the whole UK if you don’t want to break up the Union.
    

            Conservatives loathe this, as they have long hailed the ability to independently trade with countries around the world as the prize for Brexit (see why that is a fantasy 
). 
    

            Then there’s the opposition Labour Party and its fudgy Brexit policy. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn seemed to as good as admit on Monday that he accepted the negotiations were closed and that the EU would not budge on the border. He also implied that May should stand aside and allow a leader (presumably one J. Corbyn) capable of negotiating a better deal to take over. It doesn’t take a genius to work out the problem here.  
    

            Labour’s other problem is that it is almost as divided as the Conservative Party on Brexit – especially on the matter of a second referendum, or the People’s Vote, as it’s known. Corbyn and his top team seem reluctant to endorse this outright. They certainly don’t want to be seen as supporting any efforts to prevent Brexit – something many in Westminster believe to be the ultimate intention of the People’s Vote.  
    

            The People’s Vote is backed by people across the political spectrum. And its supporters have extra pep in their step after the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK could hypothetically revoke Article 50, should it want to and with a mountain of caveats.
    

      
      

      

    

            But with only 15 weeks to go until Brexit, it’s not exactly clear how such a vote could even be carried out, which of the two main parties would back what side, how it would be funded, what the question would be, how many answers there would be and what government would legislate for it. 
    

            Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, the EU has said repeatedly that negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement are not going to be reopened; it is likely not possible to have a second referendum before Brexit Day (ergo, the UK would very much not unilaterally have to ask the EU to extend Article 50); there is no guarantee that the Norway option is something the EU even wants (why would it want the second largest EEA economy unbeholden to EU law?); and, whisper it, but both frontbenches support Brexit and would likely have to were there a second referendum. 
    

            So how’s that for clarity? For some unknown reason, politicians of all factions and levels of seniority have had their ill-considered whims indulged for over two years now. Rather than be forcibly whipped in line and made to confront reality, the UK’s all-consuming political vacuum has created a safe space for a sort of fantasy land.
    

            Meanwhile, with only 15 weeks to go until Brexit day, the world still has no clarity on what’s about to become of its fifth largest economy. 
    

            It might be funny if it wasn’t so terrifying.

Snowden's father says he wants to get on with his life but stresses that he loves his son
Snowden fled the U.S. after leaking information about NSA spy programs 
He received asylum in Russia after being holed up at a Moscow airport for weeks

            The father of NSA leaker 
 told reporters in Moscow that he thinks his son deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.
    

            He arrived there Thursday for his first visit with his son since the former government IT contractor fled the United States after leaking National Security Agency spy program details to the media.
    

            Members of the European Parliament nominated Snowden  in September  for the Andrei Sakharov Prize, which honors figures who stand up to oppressive powers.  The prize was awarded to Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai on Thursday.
    

            “Edward took the Sakharov prize nomination very calmly,” Lon Snowden told reporters at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo International Airport. “He wanted to expose the injustices in the American system, and wasn’t doing it with any awards in mind.”
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Edward Snowden collected information on spy programs, in which the NSA mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States. He exposed the program to the media.
    

            Anticipating legal consequences, he initially fled to Hong Kong in late May but flew to Moscow on June 23. He was holed up at the airport for more than five weeks. U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property.
    

            Snowden received asylum in Russia on August 1 and left the airport.
    

            

    

            

    

            Lon Snowden’s visit to Russia seems shrouded in mystery, as Edward Snowden is keeping information about himself close to the vest.
    

            “I’ve had no direct contact with my son despite previous reports, so I really have no idea what his intentions are,” Lon Snowden told reporters at the airport.
    

            
 has kept a low profile, apparently not even telling his father where in Russia he is living. 
    

            “I cannot answer the question if Edward is in Moscow,” Lon Snowden said. “I don’t know that. I haven’t been informed where Edward is right now.”
    

            His lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, also has not disclosed Snowden’s location. But he told reporters that he had met with him Wednesday.  
    

            It appears that Snowden is settling in to his new surroundings.
    

            He has been living from savings and donations but has had some job offers, Kucherena said.
    

            “I am confident that he would find a high-paying job. He is very capable.”  He is also learning Russian and soaking in Russian culture, Kucherena said.
    

            And he has a girlfriend.
    

            The lawyer earlier told reporters that Edward Snowden may hold a news conference soon, but later reversed that, saying the former contractor had no intention of speaking publicly.
    

            Since the movie “The Fifth Estate” came out, which is based on the experiences of WikiLeaker Julian Assange, producers have contacted Snowden about telling his story on film. 
    

            But he does not seem interested at the time.
    

            

    

            As in the past, Lon Snowden defended his son’s actions Thursday, calling him a “whistle-blower” who is “not leaking information.”  
    

            “I don’t think the American public knows all the details of what my son did,” he said.
    

            Snowden has said that he does not expect his son to receive a fair trial in the United States and would not want him to come home, until that changes. 
    

            “I’m not sure that my son will be returning to the U.S. again. That’s his decision. He is an adult,” the elder Snowden told reporters.
    

            He thanked the Russian people and President Vladimir Putin for taking his son in. “I consider Edward to be absolutely safe in Russia. He is comfortable here,” he said.
    

            Lon Snowden has received a visa for multiple entries into the country.  “I hope to return to Russia many times,” he said.

Williams made last year's final 
Tough day for Americans in Melbourne 
Rafael Nadal crushes Victor Estrella Burgos

            Comebacks were the order of the day at the Australian Open. 
    

            Typically understated in victory, Williams on that occasion dropped her racket, pirouetted and skipped to the net. A double pirouette soon followed and you couldn’t wipe the smile off her face. It set the tone for a fine 2017 season, even if the evergreen Williams lost to younger sister Serena in the final. 
    

            

    

            

    

            But handed with a tough draw at this year’s Australian Open, the seven-time grand slam champion couldn’t replicate last year’s success at Melbourne Park and was upset by a resurgent Belinda Bencic 6-3 7-5 on what was a difficult day for Americans on the first day of the year’s first major. 
    

            “This is, like, a new year,” Williams, who was seeking to become the oldest grand slam winner in tennis history, told reporters. “You can’t live in the previous year. It’s impossible.
    

            “I don’t think I played a bad match. She just played above and beyond. I just have to give her credit for that.”
    

            With Serena skipping the event because the record 23-time grand slam winner isn’t ready to return to tournament play four months after giving birth to a first child, it means no Williams sister is in the second round of a major for the first time since 1997.

            Joining the 37-year-old Venus in making early exits were Sloane Stephens – who hasn’t won a match since surprisingly 
in September – and Vandeweghe. All three made the semifinals in New York. 
    

            The fourth American semifinalist at Flushing Meadows, Madison Keys, is still in contention – she won’t contest her opener against China’s Wang Qiang until Tuesday. 
    

            And men’s eighth seed Jack Sock, a semifinalist at the year-end Tour Finals in London in November, tumbled at the hands of Japan’s Yuichi Sugita 6-1 7-6 (7-4) 5-7 6-3. 
    

            Of the 15 Americans on the schedule Monday, only three – Ryan Harrison, qualifier Mackenzie McDonald and Nicole Gibbs – prevailed.
    

            Another player who enjoyed success in New York was also eliminated, men’s finalist Kevin Anderson. The Florida-based South African fell to Kyle Edmund – the lone British man in the draw in the

 and remember you aren’t in the draw 😢 

            Bencic encountered a Williams sister in the first round for a second consecutive Australian Open – she lost to Serena 12 months ago – but this time around the former prodigy was in much better form. 
    

            Having climbed to seventh in the rankings in 2016, back and wrist injuries heavily contributed to the Swiss dropping to 317th last season. 
    

            Bencic, however, finished 2017 by going 28-3 at all levels and combined with Roger Federer to help Switzerland win this month’s Hopman Cup. Federer’s parents were in the 20-year-old’s player box at Rod Laver Arena. 
    

            The Swiss took the final four games of the first set, then rallied from a break down in the second to register a first win over Williams in five attempts.

            “It was amazing, this match,” Bencic told reporters. 
    

            “I think the level was great. Also she beat me four times before, so I was really happy, took my chance this time.
    

            “Obviously just happy to be back playing. It was a very, very long time when I was out. I couldn’t wait to come back, so it means a lot.”
    

            

    

            

    

            Given Bencic’s form, don’t discount a long stay in Melbourne. With Serena out of action – just as she was for the final three majors of 2017 – the women’s draw is fairly wide open as Vandeweghe’s conqueror, Timea Babos, acknowledged. 
    

            “In women’s tennis, I think we see it – anything can happen when there is no Serena Williams,” said the Hungarian, who triumphed 7-6 (7-4) 6-2. 
    

            Vandeweghe received a code violation from chair umpire Fergus Murphy, as she wasn’t ready to take to the court because she was eating a banana. Vandeweghe said she had to wait for the bananas – a good source of potassium – to be brought courtside, hence the delay. 
    

            Stephens was ruled out of this month’s Brisbane International with a knee injury and lost in straight sets to Camila Giorgi in the first round in Sydney, hardly the best preparation for Melbourne. 
    

            Not serving out the match at 5-4 in the second set Monday was the obvious turning point and the 13th seed went out to China’s Zhang Shuai – somewhat of a fan favorite at the Australian Open – 2-6 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 to suffer an eighth straight defeat. 
    

            “I did everything that I could to be ready for Sydney last week and for here,” Stephens told reporters. “It’s just unfortunate, but it’s definitely only the beginning of the season, first two tournaments. Not going to get too down.”
    

            Zhang was close to quitting tennis following an 0-for-14 skid at grand slams. Her fortunes changed, though, when she upset Simona Halep in the first round in Melbourne two years ago and last week she narrowly missed out on a seeding for Melbourne, coming in ranked 34th. 
    

            Rafael Nadal progressed to the second round in 94 minutes, downing 37-year-old Victor Estrella Burgos 6-1 6-1 6-1. It was a flawless start from  the world No. 1, who is playing the Australian Open for the first time without competing at a warmup tournament. Blame his knees. 
    

            

    

            Nadal drew as much attention for his attire, going back to a sleeveless look for the first time in nearly a decade. 
    

            The man Nadal lost to in last year’s gripping men’s finale, Federer, begins his quest for a 20th major Tuesday against Slovenia’s Aljaz Bedene. 
    

            Six-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic, meanwhile, plays his first official match since Wimbledon against Donald Young. 
    

            If Young topples Djokovic, it would no doubt bring some joy to American tennis in Melbourne following Monday’s dreadful start.

            In a widely shared Twitter post, Liverpool and Egypt star Mo Salah urged world leaders, specifically British Minister Boris Johnson, “to do everything in their power to make sure the violence and killing of innocent people stops immediately.”
    
I’m calling on all the world leaders including on the Prime Minister of the country that has been my home for the past 4 years to do everything in their power to make sure the violence and killing of innocent people stops immediately. Enough is enough.  

            But the post generated as much comment for what it didn’t say, as for what it did.
    

            “Mo Salah, say it with me, Pal-es-tine,” tweeted law professor Khaled Beydoun of the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville School of Law in reply to Salah.
    

            Author Samar Jarrah tweeted: “Hope next tweet you will mention Palestinians.”
    

            In an earlier tweet, Salah posted a photo of himself standing in front of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.
    
Hope next tweet you will mention Palestinians.

            Dozens of people, including women and children, have been killed and hundreds more injured in Israeli bombing raids across Gaza this week, according to Palestinian health officials. While militants in Gaza have fired more than 1,000 rockets into Israel in recent days, killing at least five Israeli citizens and injuring 200 more, the Israeli military said.
    

            Salah isn’t the only high-profile Premier League footballer tweeting about the escalating violence between Palestinians and Israel, notably Manchester City stars Benjamin Mendy and Riyad Mahrez have both tweeted to show their solidarity with the Palestinians.

            Inter Milan star Achraf Hakimi and Porto’s Moussa Marega also tweeted their support of Palestinians.
    

            Last weekend, players of Chilean first division club Palestino – founded in 1920 by Palestinian immigrants – wore the keffiyeh, a chequered black and white traditional Arab scarf, before their match against Colo-Colo to show their support for Palestinians.

            On Wednesday, British PM Johnson tweeted: “I am urging Israel and the Palestinians to step back from the brink and for both sides to show restraint. The UK is deeply concerned by the growing violence and civilian casualties and we want to see an urgent de-escalation of tensions.”

            Australian Prime Minister has warned people to “stop hoarding,” as shoppers across the country empty supermarket shelves amid rising alarm over the rapid spread of the 
, which has infected almost 180,000 people worldwide.
    

            Videos show people swarming grocery stores and fighting over essentials such as toilet paper. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Morrison bluntly told Australians to “stop hoarding” essential foodstuffs. 
    

            “Stop it. It’s not sensible, it’s not helpful and I’ve got to say, it’s been one of the most disappointing things I’ve seen in Australian behavior in response to this crisis. That is not who we are as a people,” he said.
    

            Morrison, who has faced criticism from some doctors for not imposing stricter social isolation measures, also announced extended restrictions on mass gatherings to all indoor events with more than 100 people, however, he insisted that schools would remain open to ensure hospitals were properly staffed.
    

            “This is a once-in-100 year type event, we haven’t seen this sort of thing in Australia since the end of the first World War, but together we are of course up to this challenge,” he said.
    

            Morrison warned the disruptions could continue for “at least six months … it could be much longer.” 
    

            As of Wednesday there were more than 450 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Australia, according to local health authorities. That’s up from just over 100, a little more than one week previous.
    

            The virus is still spreading rapidly around the world, with 
 killed, 

    

            The first few months of 2020 have been particularly hard for Australians, who endured summer bushfires that 
 and made headlines around the world.
    

            The onset of another crisis has caused anxiety in the country that critics say the government has failed to assuage.
    

            Some fear the rapid rise in coronavirus cases suggest that Australia’s normally robust health system could be overwhelmed, like Italy’s where more than 2,000 people have died, according to the WHO.
    

            Australia’s response to the outbreak is being led by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), which has stressed the need for social distancing to slow the spread of the disease.
    

            “We are in a situation now where there are mainly imported cases, small numbers, there is no need for to be in a state of heightened anxiety but we do need to be prepared,” said Brendan Murphy, Australia’s Chief Medical Officer, who chairs the AHPPC.

 on panic buying in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 
 
 
 
 

            But shoppers have largely ignored calls for calm. CNN affiliate Seven News reported that police had to be called into 
 Wednesday to help organize masses of shoppers who were panic buying.
    

            Some large supermarkets in major cities such as Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Sydney have sold out of fruit, vegetables, meat and dry goods, such as a rice, as Australians buy up essentials amid fears of a lengthy epidemic.
    

            Melbourne father Matthew Weijers told CNN he hadn’t even been able to find diapers for his daughter Adelyn given the widespread panic buying.
    

            “It’s crazy, everyone came together over the bushfires and now they’re fighting for supplies in the lines at supermarkets,” he said.
    
Virus fears are still choking supermarkets with shelves remaining bare in many suburbs across the country. The fight for toilet paper was escalated in a Sydney Woolworths as fists were being thrown, before staff intervened. 
 
 
 

            On Wednesday, leading supermarket chain Woolworths banned shoppers from buying more than two of any single type of packaged goods. Toilet roll restrictions were already in place at major supermarkets, preventing customers from buying more than one pack each.
    

            Australia exports most of the food it produces and recent rain has ensured that crops aren’t in short supply.
    

            “We’re certainly not running out of food,” National Farmers’ Federation chief executive Tony Mahar told the ABC. “There’s lots to go around.”
    

            Australia’s travel alert level has been raised to Level 4, as of Wednesday, which calls on all citizens to avoid any international travel. Anyone who arrives in the country from overseas will now be required to self-quarantine for 14 days.
    

            Australians abroad have been urged to travel home as soon as possible on commercial flights, as consular help maybe not be available should more countries decide to close their borders.
    

            Major sporting and private events
have been canceled and the government has taken the unprecedented step of canceling Australia’s Anzac Day commemorations on April 25, a major annual ceremony and march honoring citizens who died while serving in the military during major conflicts.
    

            But unlike other countries facing a coronavirus epidemic, public outdoor gatherings of up to 500 people are still allowed and schools remain open. 
    

            Parents and teachers’ unions have questioned the move to continue classes, with NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos saying in a statement that many schools could easily classify as 

    

            “The lack of clarity, consistency and, at times, conflicting advice and opinions expressed by the medical community and elected leaders is creating considerable stress for teachers and principals,” he said in a statement Tuesday.

 in Pyeongchang, but it’s the whipping wind that has hampered races in recent days and raised concerns over competitors’ safety. 
    

            Temperatures in South Korea are registering around -11˚C (12˚F). 
    

            When combined with wind chill, however, the mercury plummets dramatically to -26˚C (-14˚F) degrees. 
    

            While it’s not uncommon for Alpine sports to face high winds and excessive snow, the extreme conditions in Pyeongchang have made staging events increasingly challenging.
    

            Officials have called-off several competitions including the women’s giant slalom which was due to take place Monday at the Yongpyong Alpine Center. 
    

            The weather could become “a real problem for the organizers because this is forecast to last for at least the next four days,” CNN’s Christina Macfarlane reported from the Games. 
    

            The women’s giant slalom has been rescheduled for Thursday, according to the US Ski and Snowboard Team – the same day as the postponed men’s downhill race, which was delayed on Sunday.
    

            Olympic downhill is traditionally one of the Games’ biggest draws and this year’s competition is likely the last chance for Olympic veterans like Aksel Lund Svindal and Lindsey Vonn to win gold. 
    

            Ninety-eight-percent of the snow on the course is artificial as the weather is too cold for the snow to fall. But some athletes will prefer “fake snow” on the course as it keeps the conditions more consistent.
    
It's pretty windy in Pyeongchang. Just ask 
.
 
 

            One race that did proceed on Monday was the final of the ladies’ snowboard slopestyle. Bone-chilling gusts of wind tore through the mountains as American snowboarder Jamie Anderson managed to successfully retain the title, while Laurie Blouin from Canada won silver and Finland’s Enni Rukajarvi took home bronze. 
    

            Even after a delayed start, windy conditions at Phoenix Snow Park had a noticeable and sometime farcical effect on many of the competitors, with most failing to complete a single clean run after being blown off course by intense crosswinds.
    
At the snowboard slopestyle, where six of the first seven have crashed, and one didn't even attempt a jump. Strong winds playing havoc.

            
 
    

            Sung Baik-you, spokesman for the local organizing committee said Monday that the winds had been very strong, making the competition difficult but that the safety of the athletes was their top priority leading to some events being rescheduled. 
    

            The International Ski Federation also issued a statement on Monday in response to athletes, coaches and fans who complained about the strong winds which made conditions “dangerous” and made it tough for some athletes to perform at their best. 
    

            FIS said it “would never stage a competition” if the safety of athletes could not be assured. 
    

            The organization added the weather was deemed stable enough for the competition to continue after a 30-minute delay where officials monitored conditions and a 45-minute training session without problems. 
    

            However, some competitors have come to the IOC’s defense, praising organizers for their handling of the events. 
    

            After qualification for the snowboard ladies’ halfpipe final at the Phoenix Snow Park on Monday, American Chloe Kim described the conditions as “amazing” while Emily Arthur from Australia called the atmosphere “insane.”
    

            “This is the best pipe I’ve ever ridden,” Arthur said.  
    

            On Sunday, Australian snowboarder Tess Coady lamented the conditions many are facing after suffering a serious injury during a practice session.

            During winter, plants are able to protect themselves from frost because they put themselves in a dormant “winter sleep” mode, Büntgen told CNN. 
    

            However, an early spring brings forward the “vegetation period,” the phase when plants begin to grow. If a frost occurs during this time, the plants will suffer, and some may die.
    

            Fruit trees are particularly at risk of a late frost, which could bring serious consequences for fruit farmers, who stand to lose entire crop yields.
    

            While the study speaks to a long-term trend, other parts of the world have reported recent early flowering seasons. Last March, 
 recorded its 
. In 2019, a heat wave in the United States caused 
 to bloom earlier than usual, because they are susceptible to temperature changes. While people enjoyed the early blooms, the overenthusiastic flowers made it harder for farmers to plant other crops in those areas.
    

            Another cause for concern is something researchers call “ecological mismatch.” 
    

            Plants, insects, birds and other wildlife have evolved over time to coordinate the way they develop. A change to this cycle can initiate a chain reaction, causing damage to ecosystems.
    

            “A certain plant flowers and attracts a particular type of insect, which attracts a particular type of bird, and so on,” Büntgen said. 
    

            “But if one component responds faster than the others, there’s a risk that they’ll be out of sync, which can cause species to collapse and lead to biodiversity loss if they can’t adapt quickly enough.”
    

      
      

      

    

            The study is based on the analysis of more than 400,000 observations of over 400 plant species dating back to the mid-18th century until 2019. The database relies on citizen reporting, or crowd sourcing. 
    

            Researchers looked at the first flowering dates of trees, shrubs, herbs and climbers in locations from the Channel Islands to Shetland in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and classified their findings by location, elevation and whether they were from urban or rural areas.
    

            The first flowering dates were compared with monthly climate records, which showed that the average first flowering had advanced by an entire month and is strongly linked to rising global temperatures.
    

            This data is stored by the Woodland Trust in what’s known as 
, a database with 3.5 million entries that date back to the 1730s.
    

            Rather than breaking the data down to look at individual species, which can become “too noisy” and inconclusive, the study focused on a bigger sample size to ensure the data is robust, Büntgen said. 
    

            “To really understand what climate change is doing to our world, we need these much larger datasets that look at whole ecosystems over a long period of time.”
    

            He added that Nature’s Calendar was a rich data source with high scientific value. 
    

            “Alongside temperature records, we can use it to quantify how climate change is affecting various ecosystems across the UK.”

            The blimp fell out of the sky and burst into flames as the world’s best golfers competed in the first round of the 117th US Open Championship in Wisconsin.

            US Open competitor Jamie Lovemark said he was about to drive on the fifth hole when he saw the blimp in trouble.
    

            ” I was teeing off and I looked up and saw it on fire, and I felt sick to my stomach,” he told reporters. “I had the shakes. I felt terrible for the people inside. It was horrible.”

            The Erin Hills course – at 7,741 yards the longest in US Open history – was expected to prove a severe test, but world No. 9 Rickie Fowler scorched into the first-round lead with a stunning seven-under 65.
    

            The 28-year-old, who is still chasing a first major title, ended the day one shot clear of England’s Paul Casey and American qualifier Xander Schauffelle and two ahead of Americans Brian Harman and Brooks Koepka and Englishman Tommy Fleetwood.
    

            “It was nice. You don’t get many rounds at the US Open that are stress-free,” said Fowler, who won the last of his four PGA Tour titles at the Honda Classic in February.
    

            Defending champion Dustin Johnson, whose fiancee Paulina Gretzky gave birth to the couple’s second child – named River Jones Johnson – Monday, found it more of a struggle and finished with a three-over 75.

            The last player to win back-to-back US Opens was Curtis Strange in 1989.
    

            World No. 2 Rory McIlroy visited parts of Erin Hills he would rather not have in a six-over 78 and was left to rue comments he made in the build-up when he dismissed criticism of the course’s long rough. 
    

            Several players posted videos on social media mocking the waist-high grass along several holes, but McIlroy, back after five weeks out with a rib injury, said the fairways were ample, adding “if we can’t hit within that avenue, you might as well pack your bags and go home.”

            The body was under pressure to host a successful tournament following the farcical final round last year when Johnson was eventually penalised for moving his ball on a green, and for the poor condition of the Chambers Bay course the year before.

            FIFA President Sepp Blatter will not stand for re-election later this year, a spokesperson for football’s world governing body told CNN on Friday. 
    

            There has been speculation the 79-year-old may try to hang on to the most powerful role in world football after Friday’s edition of Swiss newspaper Blick quoted Blatter as saying “I have not resigned.”
    

            On June 2, just four days after his re-election, Blatter announced he would “lay down” his mandate as a corruption scandal engulfed FIFA. 
    

            Asked by CNN whether the Swiss administrator would be a candidate when new presidential elections are held, the FIFA spokesperson replied: “No – he will not be.” 
    

            Blatter, who has been in power since 1998, caused confusion when speaking at an event for the workers who will build a FIFA museum in Zurich. He said he was not ready to be part of any antiquarian collection himself. 
    

            “I have not resigned. I have put my mandate in the hands of an Extraordinary Congress,” Blatter was 
 by Blick. 
    

            “Don’t get me wrong. I’m not ready for the museum nor for waxworks!” 
    

            The address was greeted with cheering and applause according to Blick, whose quotes were described as accurate by FIFA. 
    

            However, the FIFA spokesperson said Blatter was simply trying to point out that he had not stopped working as president following his resignation announcement – and would not do so until he is replaced at the Extraordinary Congress, which is expected to be held in December but could be as late as March 2016. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            The Executive Committee will meet on July 20 to determine the exact date for the congress. 
    

            Blatter has history when it comes to making U-turns.
    

            In March 2011, he told a UEFA Congress ahead of that year’s FIFA presidential elections that if he was re-elected, “these will be the last years for which I stand as a candidate.”
    

            This did not happen however, as Blatter stood again this year – and won his fifth term in office. 
    

            His resignation days later came amid the biggest scandal in FIFA’s 111-year history. 
    

            Last month, the United States indicted 14 people, including nine top FIFA officials, on corruption charges. 
    

            A Swiss probe is also investigating potential irregularities in the bidding process to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which Russia and Qatar will respectively host. 
    

            Earlier this month, Domenico Scala – the official overseeing the new FIFA presidential elections – said Blatter’s departure was an “indispensable” part of planned reforms for the embattled organization.

            UK Prime Minister Theresa May declared Brexit negotiations were “in the endgame” Monday night, but warned that clinching a deal was “immensely difficult.”
    

            Addressing leaders of London’s financial district, where anxiety is mounting about the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit, May said that an agreement would not come “at any cost.”
    

            “Any deal must ensure we take back control of our laws, borders and money,” she said. “It must secure the ability to strike new trade deals around the world.”
    

      
      

      

    

            Michel Barnier, the chief European Union negotiator, earlier that day told European ministers negotiations had run into the early hours of Monday morning.
    

            Talks were so intense and protracted that Barnier canceled a planned press conference Monday so he could continue thrashing out a deal, a European diplomat told CNN.
    

            A key sticking point is the Irish border. 
    

            Currently, the UK and Ireland are both part of the EU single market, so goods passing between the two regions do not need customs inspections.
    

            Both sides want to avoid a “hard border” between Northern Ireland and Ireland which would require 
 and customs checks, but cannot agree on the terms.
    

            If no agreement is made, a backstop will come into effect in 2020 which will effectively see Northern Ireland remain in the EU customs union.
    

            Both EU and British officials declined to comment on reports that European Council President Donald Tusk had given May a deadline of Wednesday night to agree a deal.
    

            Once Barnier indicates that sufficient progress has been made towards a deal, it will take 10 days to two weeks to call a summit to approve it, the officials said.
    

            May has been scrambling to finalize a deal by the end of November in order to put a “meaningful final vote” before MPs ahead of Christmas. 
    

            Time is ticking. The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, 2019.
    

            Earlier this week, Jo Johnson resigned as transport minister and called for a second referendum on Brexit.
    

            “We are barreling towards an incoherent Brexit that is going to leave us trapped in a subordinate relationship to the EU, with no say over the rules that will govern huge swathes of our economy,”Johnson said in a video statement posted online. 
    

            After nearly 18 months of grueling negotiations, May is widely reported to be nearing a deal that would tie Britain to EU rules and regulations for a transition period. 
    

            The prime minister has flatly rejected calls for a second Brexit vote. “The referendum in 2016 was the biggest democratic exercise in this country’s history,” her spokesperson told CNN. “We will not under any circumstances have a second referendum.”

            It is the most Zlatan Ibrahimovic way possible of putting yourself on the transfer market.
    

            The Swedish striker’s tweet, announcing that Saturday’s match against Nantes will be his last for Paris Saint-Germain, leaves people in no doubt as to his intentions, or his view on the legacy he leaves in France.
    

            The 34-year-old has won four straight Ligue 1 titles with the French club and seven cup competitions, but success in the European Champions League has eluded him – PSG failing to make it past the quarterfinals in the last three seasons.

            His departure was later confirmed on the club’s official website in a statement that also revealed he would return in a “managerial capacity” once his playing career had ended.
    

            “I am very proud of the last four years,” he said. “I loved every day I spent here. Paris Saint-Germain has become a star club in the world and I played a key role moving it forward. 
    

            “It is now the right time for me to take a different path. I would like to thank my teammates, the technical staff and all the people in the club. My heart is with the fans. They were amazing from the first day I came here. They are the best fans in France. 
    

            “It is not a farewell but only an au revoir. I came like a king, I leave like a legend but I will be back.” 
    

            Ibrahimovic will not be short of suitors.
    

            He has been linked with a move to the English Premier League with Manchester United, Los Angeles Galaxy in MLS and a return to Italian giants AC Milan, where he spent two seasons between 2010 and 2012.
    

            A return of 46 goals in 49 matches for PSG this season still proves he can cut it at the top level, while his 36 league goals propelled it to a fourth consecutive crown.
    

            The mercurial forward is always good for a soundbite, constantly referring to himself in the third person. When once asked by reporters what he’d be getting his girlfriend for her birthday he replied: “Nothing. She has Zlatan.”

            After criticism from Norwegian striker John Carew, Ibrahimovic famously retorted: “What Carew can do with a football, I can do with an orange.”

            “I am extremely proud of having welcomed Ibra in Paris and I’m now looking forward to the prospect of working with him again at the club when he finishes his career. He will always be home at Paris Saint-Germain.”

Barcelona top table after coming from behind to beat Osasuna
Contrasting fortunes for Milan clubs in Serie A start

            Real Madrid crashed to a shock 2-1 defeat to city neighbors Getafe in the second round of the Spanish La Liga season Sunday.
    

            After being held 1-1 by Valencia in their opener, Jose Mourinho’s champions are left with a solitary point after two games, trailing arch rivals Barcelona by five points.
    

            Gonzalo Higuain put Real ahead after 26 minutes and they appeared set for a routine derby victory.
    

            But Juan Valera was unmarked as he headed Getafe level after 52 minutes from a free kick.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Real’s star-studded attack led by Cristiano Ronaldo pressed for the winner, but it was the home side who grabbed their second  with Abdelaziz Barrada scoring in the 74th minute after an assist by Adrian Colunga.
    

            Earlier, Lionel Messi came to Barcelona’s rescue with a late double as they beat Osasuna 2-1 to go top of the standings on goal difference from Rayo Vallecano after two games.
    

            New Barca coach Tito Vilanova had been sent off for complaining to the referee as they trailed to a 17th-minute goal  from Joseba Llorente.
    

            The former European champions had wasted a string of chances until Messi struck in the 75th and 80th minutes.
    

            Osasuna’s Francisco Punal was shown red for his protests after Messi’s first goal, claiming he was offside.
    

            Barcelona and Real Madrid will resume their rivalry Wednesday as the Catalans take a 3-2 lead to the Santiago Bernabeu after first leg of the Spanish Super Cup.
    

            In Serie A, the start of the season has seen contrasting fortunes for the Milan clubs.
    

            AC Milan, runners-up last season, lost 1-0 in the San Siro to newly promoted Sampdoria with Andrea Costa scoring the winner in the second  half.
    

            But Inter Milan showed their city rivals how it should be done with a 3-0 win at another promoted side, Pescara, to top the early standings with Napoli, who won 3-0 at Palermo.
    

            On Saturday, Juventus began their defense of the title with a 2-0 victory at home to Parma.

            Six people linked to the far-right were arrested in France on Tuesday as part of an investigation into a suspected plot to attack President Emmanuel Macron, officials told CNN Tuesday. 
    

            France’s intelligence agency, the DGSI, said the six people were arrested in three separate regions: Isère, southeast of Lyon; Moselle, on the border with Germany and Luxembourg; and Ille-et-Vilaine, in the northwest near the city of Rennes.
    

            The suspects include five men and a woman between the ages of 22 and 62, a judicial source close to the probe told CNN. All have connections to the far-right, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. 
    

            “The investigation is looking into an imprecise and loosely formed plan for violent action against the President of the Republic,” said the judicial source, who declined to be named discussing an ongoing investigation. 
    

            The arrests come after Macron warned 
on Sunday of the rising threat of the far-right movement, adding that complacency in the early 1900s paved the way for Hitler’s rise in Germany and Mussolini in Italy.
    

            According to Reuters, France’s far-right euroskeptic National Rally – formerly known as the National Front – is leading the polls against Macron ahead of the European Parliament election in May. The party is led by

    

            France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said Monday that the country remained “on alert” over threats posed by “extremist networks both on the right and left, which are quite active in our country,” 
 to France 24.
    

            In June, 10 members of a far-right group called 
 (Operational Forces Action) were 
 with an alleged plot to attack Muslims. 
    

            And in October 2017, anti-terrorism police arrested 10 people 
 over alleged plans to attack mosques, migrants and leftist politician Jean-Luc Melenchon. 
    

            Macron has also been targeted before. During the Bastille Day celebrations in July 2017, a 23-year-old was charged over a plot to assassinate the President.
    

            Investigators said the man planned to attack Macron on July 14, during a parade on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, where US President Donald Trump was set to be a guest of honor. 
    

            A self-described far-right nationalist, the man told police he wanted to make a political statement by killing Macron, 
.
    

            The six arrests on Tuesday come as France begins to commemorate the centenary of the World War I armistice.

2012-01-15 17:44:00+00:00,,"NEW: 200 passengers swam to shore, Little Rock man says
The tilting ship and rising water evoked the film ""Titanic,"" a crew member says
There was chaos on board as passengers tried to find lifeboats in darkness
The luxury cruise ship was designed to appeal to young couples and families 

            The 3,200 passengers aboard the Costa Concordia cruise liner were enjoying a night of entertainment and relaxation off Italy’s Mediterranean coast.
    

            Then, at about dinnertime, the lights went out, an ominous scraping sound moaned through the hull, and the ship tilted to one side.
    

            The 1,500-cabin luxury vessel, which was also carrying about 1,000 crew members, had run aground on a rocky sandbar off the tiny island of Giglio.
    

            Chaos overwhelmed passengers and crew alike when, as the ship listed and water rose as if it were a scene from “Titanic,” everyone realized that only one side of the ship’s lifeboats and rafts were reachable.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Amid screams, the crew appeared helpless, according to one passenger who had to make a ladder of rope to save himself and his wife.
    

            “It was the Marx brothers watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat,” said Benji Smith, who was on the Concordia for his honeymoon with his wife, Emily. The couple live in Boston.
    

            “I felt like the disaster itself was manageable,” Smith added, referring to the grounding and tilting of the ship, “but I felt like the crew was going to kill us.”
    

            The worst part came when a lifeboat crew member told everyone, “Women and children first,” Smith said. “All these families who were clinging to each other had to be separated,” he added.
    

            After helping passengers, some crew members jumped overboard and swam ashore.
    

            

    

            At least three lifeboats apparently malfunctioned due to technical or crew error, Smith said.
    

            Life rafts were “twisting and turning,” and the crew pulled in some rafts and put the people back on the ship, but the crew never returned for them, Smith said.
    

            With the ship’s staircases flooded, “we made ladders out of ropes to climb down from the outer fourth deck to the third deck,” Smith said.
    

            “We waited clinging to those rope ladders for 3½ hours” before being picked up by a lifeboat that returned from dropping passengers onshore, he said.
    

            Smith said he and his wife never heard from any of the officers or captain during the incident.
    

            The couple was eventually transported by bus to a hotel in Rome.
    

            “I’ve been awake for 40 hours – I still have never spoken to a person from Costa,” he said, adding that no food, clothes, or money were provided by the cruise line. 
    

            Many passengers complained about how the cruise ship staff handled the crisis and asked why they had not yet received an obligatory safety briefing when disaster struck, only hours into their journey.
    

            “We attended a safety presentation on the first day,” but he says it didn’t turn out to have any safety information, he said. “It was only a sales pitch” for shore excursions, Smith said. 
    

            Mark Plath of Little Rock, Arkansas, said 200 passengers swam about 100 yards to rocks, where they awaited further assistance.
    

            “We were helping the staff more than they were helping us,” Plath said of the ordeal.
    

            Rosalyn Rincon, a member of the cruise ship staff who worked as a dancer, was in the middle of a magician’s act when the ship ran aground. She was inside a box during a magic show when, she said, “I realized that everything stopped. The music stopped,” she said.
    

            Everything on the stage fell on top of people because the ship listed dramatically, said Rincon, 30, of Blackpool, England.
    

            “There was no signal as to what was going on until about 30 minutes into it,” Rincon told CNN.
    

            Her boyfriend, an Italian engineer officer on the vessel, told her that there was a blackout and the ship crashed into something. “They told us there was a fire,” she said.
    

            Then another blackout occurred, and the ship went into darkness, she said. She put on her life vest in her cabin, she said.
    

            About 15 minutes later, “the captain of the ship told us it was an electrical problem,” Rincon said.
    

            Rincon thought to herself: “If it was an electrical problem, why were we tilting,” she said.
    

            Several minutes later, “we were told to abandon ship,” Rincon said.
    

            Then panic set in, she said.
    

            “This is the problem: You’ve got 3,000 passengers, you’ve got 2,000 crew members, and you got only one side of usage of lifeboats and life rafts” because the ship was resting on one side, Rincon said in a telephone interview from her Italian hotel.
    

            Rincon realized there was going to be a shortage of lifesaving watercraft, she said.
    

            “You were going higher and higher, and you were on a vertical position. I was holding on to the railing. All you could see was noise and creaks. It was very, very scary,” Rincon said.
    

            Rincon was able to get into a rescue boat – after all the passengers were put on lifeboats or life rafts, she said.
    

            “We were literally thrown into the boat,” Rincon said.
    

            Several crew members jumped overboard and swam to the mountain shore, she said. One friend was rescued by helicopter from the top of the ship, Rincon said.
    

            Passenger Laurie Willits from Ontario, Canada, who was watching the magic show with her husband, told CNN: “All of a sudden the lights flashed, and the boat tipped like it was turning, but it didn’t return to level.” 
    

            Emergency announcements in English and other languages were difficult to hear, Willits said. 
    

            Panic spread as people scrambled to find lifeboats in the dark as the ship quickly leaned to one side. 
    

            Lifeboats on the higher side got stuck, Willits said, leaving some people suspended in mid-air for a long time. The sounds of children crying and screaming could be heard.
    

            Willits and her husband managed to get into a lifeboat about an hour to 90 minutes after the alarm was raised, and were among the first to be taken to land.
    

            American Nancy Lofaro said she and her husband Mario were watching the magic show, when there was a “grinding noise.” All the performers ran off the stage, she said, leaving the audience in the theater.
    

            She added that 30 minutes passed before there was any announcement, saying everything was under control. “The crew tried hard but they kept telling us they had no information, and it wasn’t until an hour into this situation that we got into a lifeboat and were lowered.”
    

            Lofaro described a chaotic situation on the lifeboat. “At one point we were being lowered, and we were sliding off to one side. Everyone fell into one side of the boat and were slamming into the ship. This happened a few times over 30 seconds. And finally we were lowered into the water level. It took 30 minutes to get to shore… the lifeboats were slamming into each other. It was chaos.”
    

            At reception centers set up on shore Saturday, some passengers were still wearing pajamas, slippers or housecoats from when the alarm was first raised on the ship. Most were without their money, phones and valuables.
    

            Sirens blared as some of the injured were taken to hospital. Helicopters lifted some people from the badly listing ship.
    

            Rescue officials said their operation peaked between midnight and 3 a.m. Saturday, and calm seas prevented greater loss of life. Three people were confirmed dead and 20 injured.
    

            Many people spent the night in small churches and other buildings around the island before being ferried to the mainland to make their way home.
    

            The Italian cruise company, Costa Cruises, said it would help passengers return home. Costa is owned by parent company Carnival Corp.
    

            An investigation into the cause of the disaster is under way, officials said.

            Josh Hamilton, a former American League Most Valuable Player for the Texas Rangers, is accused of throwing his eldest daughter on a bed and beating her, according to an arrest warrant filed by the Keller Police Department. 
    

            Hamilton, 38, turned himself into Tarrant County authorities on Wednesday and posted bail of $35,000, Tarrant County Court spokesman Justin Davis said. 
    

            Hamilton faces one count of injury to a child, a third-degree felony in Texas. People convicted of a third-degree felony in the state face a possible sentence of between two and 10 years in prison.
    

            His next court date has yet to be determined, police spokesman Capt. Chad Allen said.
    

            CNN attempted to reach Hamilton on Wednesday evening but was unsuccessful. 
    

            Child protective services alerted police to the alleged late September incident, the arrest warrant says.
    

            The daughter told investigators that her father was upset at a comment she made to him and threw a full water bottle into her chest, the affidavit filed with the warrant says. She says Hamilton also threw a chair that hit her leg. She alleges that he pulled her from a chair and she injured her hip when she fell from the chair.
    

            Hamilton carried his daughter over his shoulder to her room and threw her on the bed, the affidavit says.
    

            The daughter alleges he used a hand to push her face against the bed and then hit and slap her on her legs. She says he picked her up by her sweatshirt, which tore, the affidavit says. He then hit her some more on her back and scratched her, the daughter alleges.
    

            Hamilton allegedly told her: “I hope you go in front of the (expletive) judge and tell him what a terrible dad I am so I don’t have to see you anymore and you don’t ever have to come to my house again.”
    

            The girl told her mother and police say they were contacted by child protective services.
    

            Hamilton played for three major league teams during his nine-year career. He won the American League’s Most Valuable Player award while with the Rangers in 2010 when he led the league with a spectacular .359 batting average. He was an All-Star in five seasons. He played in two World Series but his team at the time, the Rangers, lost both.
    

            Hamilton was the first pick in the 1999 draft by the Tampa Bay Rays, but didn’t play his first game in the major leagues until 2007 after he signed with the Cincinnati Reds. After one productive season there, the Rangers sought him in a trade. 
    

            
 in August that he spoke in the offseason about his battle with substance abuse. 
    

            “I had worked through substance abuse issues, gotten myself into shape, and put up some numbers in Cincy that showed I could still play this game,” he wrote. “But I knew I remained a work in progress. It was still a day-by-day kind of deal.”
    

            The Rangers sent people to hear him speak, he wrote, then traded for him. 
    

             He spent five seasons there before signing with the Los Angeles Angels, then came back to the Rangers for a final season after being traded.

            German Chancellor 
 announced on Monday that she would not seek re-election when her term expires in 2021. 
    

            Merkel, who has been Chancellor since 2005, made the announcement during a news conference today in Berlin.
    

            “It is time today for me to start a new chapter,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “This fourth term is my last term as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. In the next Bundestag election in 2021, I will not run again as Chancellor. I will not run for the German Bundestag any more, and I do not want any other political office.”
    

            Merkel told reporters that being Chancellor has been a “very challenging and fulfilling task.”
    

            Merkel’s decision appears to mark the beginning of the end of her 13-year dominance of European politics.
    

            Merkel also announced on Monday that she would stand down from the chairmanship of her center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party after 18 years in the post. 
    

            She said that she’s known since the summer break that she no longer wanted to be the CDU chairman and that during the party’s conference in December she will not run again for the position.
    

            The announcement is a sign of Merkel’s weakened power within her own party, and waning popularity in the country.
    

            Both parties under Merkel’s ruling coalition – the CDU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) – suffered heavy losses in a regional election over the weekend. 
    

            While the CDU remained the largest party in the election, which was held in the central state of Hesse, its vote was down 10% from the previous election.
    

      
      

      

    

            This weekend’s election was a second blow to Merkel’s fragile “grand coalition” government. On October 14, the Christian Social Union, or CSU – the Bavarian sister party to the CDU – lost its majority in the Bavarian state parliament.
    

            The CSU has dominated politics in the state since the end of World War II, ruling for all but three years over the course of nearly seven decades.
    

            Speaking on October 15, Merkel admitted that voters had lost trust in the government.
    

            Bavaria bore the brunt of the 2015 refugee crisis; at its peak, thousands of asylum seekers were crossing into the state every day. Since then, both Merkel and her CSU allies have been criticized for their management of the influx.
    

            Leopold Traugott, policy analyst at think tank Open Europe, told CNN that Merkel was a stable leader in a “global politics that’s become increasingly disorderly.”
    

            He said that while Germany needs to look for a new leading figure, allies and opponents abroad “will have to prepare for a different, perhaps more difficult partner in Berlin.”
    

            “Germany will become even more inward-looking in the near future – a trend we have seen since last year’s general election already,” Traugott said.
    

            “This means there will be less German involvement in key European debates, but also on global issues the country is less likely to take a leading role.
    

            “It will be particularly painful for French president Emmanuel Macron, who was hoping for Merkel’s support in his plans for wide-reaching European reform. It seems ever less likely he will receive this support from Berlin.”

            Under a threat of potential jail time, a group of British online influencers including Ellie Goulding, Rita Ora and Zoella have agreed to change how they post online, after their social media profiles were investigated by an advertising watchdog. 
    

            Sixteen celebrities, with tens of millions of followers between them, were probed over whether they were posting “misleading” advertisements online – an offense that breaches UK advertising law and carries a potential penalty of two years in prison.
    

            The stars said they will now clearly state whether they have been paid to promote a brand or product, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said.
    

            Models Alexa Chung, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Iskra Lawrence were among the group pledging to alter their posting habits, alongside a host of British reality TV stars.
    

      
      

      

    

            Warning letters have also been sent to other, unnamed celebrities, noting that “concerns have been identified” about their posts and urging them to change their practices, the CMA said.
    

            “Influencers can have a huge impact on what their fans decide to buy. People could, quite rightly, feel misled if what they thought was a recommendation from someone they admired turns out to be a marketing ploy,” Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, 

    

            “You should be able to tell as soon as you look at a post if there is some form of payment or reward involved, so you can decide whether something is really worth spending your hard-earned money on,” he added.
    

            Celebrities are regularly paid by brands to subtly advertise their products to their millions of followers, such as through product placement in photos. 
    

            But UK consumer protection law requires that they disclose whether they have been paid or incentivized to endorse a brand. 
 that related to the investigation carries penalties of fines, up to two years in prison, or both.
    

            Coscelli said the agreement “sends a clear message to all influencers, brands and businesses that they must be open and clear with their followers.”
    

            Goulding and Ora each have more than 14 million followers on Instagram, while Zoella, whose real name is Zoe Sugg, has racked up more than 1 billion views on YouTube.
    

            The investigation did not make a finding about whether the celebrities have breached the law, the CMA noted.
    

            But the group said they would be carrying out further investigative work into the “role and responsibilities of social media platforms.”

            She is entering her last competitive ski season, but Lindsey Vonn vows she will “work hard” to accomplish her final two goals – become the most successful ski racer ever and compete against men.
    

            The 34-year-old, who 
 earlier this month, needs five more World Cup wins to beat Ingemar Stenmark’s all-time record of 86 victories.
    

            The American has also long-campaigned to be allowed to enter a men’s World Cup race, but skiing’s governing body the FIS has so far blocked her requests.   
    

            “I know I’ll get asked about Swedish skier Ingemar Stenmark’s record of 86 World Cup wins, and that I never got to race against men, but I still am going to work hard to make both possible,” Vonn wrote in an article for Sports Illustrated. 
    

            Last season Vonn won five World Cup races and could compete in about 20 downhill and super-G events in her final campaign.
    

            “I still have one more season left and while I will take it all in and enjoy this year, I will also race with the same intensity and focus that I always have,” she added.
    

            

    

            The three-time Olympic medalist and two-time world champion is already the most successful female World Cup ski racer of all time. One more win this season would make her the oldest women’s World Cup winner. 
    

            At the Winter Games in South Korea in February she became the oldest woman – at 33 – to win an Olympic medal in any of the five Alpine skiing disciplines when she 

    

            Since winning gold in Vancouver in 2010, her only Olympic title, the four-time World Cup overall winner has suffered multiple injuries – fractures, knee ligament tears, concussion – and undergone surgery five times.

            Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his finance minister Rishi Sunak were
 over lockdown-breaking 
 held on UK government premises, a Downing Street spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday.
    

            London’s Metropolitan Police said earlier Tuesday they had issued more than 50 fines as part of their “Operation Hillman” investigation into gatherings held on government premises in Downing Street and Whitehall while the rest of the country was living under strict pandemic restrictions. Revelations of the parties sparked national outrage. 
    

            The police fines are confirmation that Johnson and Sunak broke Covid-19 laws created by their own government – even though the Prime Minister previously denied some parties were held and insisted all guidance was followed. The penalty makes Johnson the first sitting UK Prime Minister to be found guilty of 
.
    

            On Tuesday evening, Johnson apologized for breaching the lockdown rules, and said that he had paid the fine issued by the Metropolitan Police.
    

            “Today I’ve received a fixed penalty notice from the Metropolitan Police relating to an event in Downing Street on the 19th of June 2020. Let me say immediately that I paid the fine and I once again offer a full apology,” Johnson said on Sky News. He did not specify the amount he was fined.
    

            Sunak also apologized on Tuesday evening and said he paid the fine, saying in a statement reported by the PA Media news agency, “I deeply regret the frustration and anger caused and I am sorry.”
    

            “I understand that for figures in public office, the rules must be applied stringently in order to maintain public confidence. I respect the decision that has been made,” Sunak said.
    

            CNN affiliate ITV has previously reported that two gatherings were held to celebrate Johnson’s birthday: One attended by as many as 30 people, held at the cabinet office the afternoon of June 19, and another that evening hosted at Johnson’s residence and attended by family friends.
    

            A source who worked in Downing Street at the time previously confirmed to CNN that the gathering took place on that day and that it was arranged by his wife Carrie, who led the singing of the happy birthday song.
    

            The gathering was largely attended by what was deemed to be Johnson’s inner circle at the time, CNN understands.
    

      
      

      

    

            Johnson told Sky News on Tuesday that he did not think he was breaking the lockdown rules when attending the gathering at his office that day.
    

            “In all frankness at that time, it did not occur to me that this might have been a breach of the rules. But of course, the police have found otherwise, and I fully respect the outcome of their investigation,” he said.
    

            Johnson added that he understood the response people might have to his actions, saying, “I understand the anger that many will feel that I myself fell short, when it came to observing the very rules which the government I lead had introduced to protect the public.”
    

            He also offered his explanation of the day’s events, saying that among many “engagements on a day that happened to be my birthday, there was a brief gathering in the Cabinet Room shortly after 2pm lasting for less than 10 minutes, during which people I work with kindly passed on their good wishes.”
    

      
      

      

    

            The so-called “Partygate” scandal, which emerged in late 2021, has sparked the most serious threat to Johnson’s premiership to date. Revelations that the Prime Minister attended several parties had already prompted furious calls for him to resign even before Tuesday’s announcement of a police fine.
    

            Johnson’s handling of the scandal also sparked condemnation. The Prime Minister initially rebuffed allegations of illegal gatherings by saying there were no parties. When images from these gatherings started to appear in UK media, he said he didn’t know about them and that he was outraged. After another image emerged showing him and his wife allegedly 
, he apologized, but said he thought he was attending “a work event.”
    

            The police launched an investigation into the string of gatherings after a January report by senior civil servant Sue Gray, commissioned by the government, condemned 
to observe the standards of government. 
    

            The Gray report said the police were investigating at least 12 events – including at least two Johnson attended, and a third held in his flat that he previously told lawmakers did not happen. The police said later it was investigating events taking place on eight separate dates between May 2020 and April 2021. 
    

      
      

      

    

            The Met said in a statement it was given more than 300 photos and 500 pages of information to review during the investigations.  
    

            The campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK called on Johnson and Sunak to resign, describing their behavior as “truly shameles.”
    

            In a series of tweets on Tuesday, the group, said, “After everything it’s still unbelievably painful that @BorisJohnson was partying & breaking his own lockdown rules, while we were unable to be at loved ones’ sides in their dying moments, or in miserable funerals with only a handful of people.” 
    

            “We were following the rules. The fact that @BorisJohnson and @RishiSunak then lied about it, and would have continued to do so if the police hadn’t intervened, is truly shameless. They broke the law. But even worse, they took us all for mugs. When we met the PM in the @downingstreet  garden – the same one where they had these parties – he looked us in the eyes and said he had done everything he could to save our loved ones. We now know that that was a lie.”
    

            Main opposition Labour party leader Keir Starmer also immediately demanded that Johnson and Sunak step down. “Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak have broken the law and repeatedly lied to the British public. They must both resign. The Conservatives are totally unfit to govern. Britain deserves better,” Starmer tweeted. 
    

            Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also called for Johnson to resign. 
    

            “Boris Johnson must resign. He broke the law and repeatedly lied to parliament about it. The basic values of integrity and decency – essential to the proper working of any parliamentary democracy – demand that he go. And he should take his out of touch chancellor with him,” she said on Twitter. 
    

            On Tuesday, Johnson avoided the topic of resigning, instead saying, “As I said, just now I want to be able to get on and deliver the mandate that I have,” adding that his priority was to “get on with delivering for the people in this country.”
    

            “Of course, I take full responsibility for everything” he said, adding that he “couldn’t be everywhere at once.”

    

            London mayor Sadiq Khan also called for Johnson to quit, saying “a Prime Minister who breaks the laws his Government makes and then lies about it isn’t fit for office.”
    

            “Families made huge sacrifices and obeyed the law. Many said their last goodbyes to loved ones on the phone while the Prime Minister partied,” Khan added in a statement on Facebook.
    

            According to ministerial rules, if a government minister breaches the ministerial code, it is expected that they should resign from their job. The code includes the “overarching duty” of ministers to comply with the law.
    

            The Met Police said the investigation into illegal gatherings in Downing Street continues.

            Till Lindemann, the lead singer of German industrial metal band 
 is under investigation on allegations relating to sexual offenses and the distribution of narcotics on the basis of “several criminal complaints,” according to a spokeswoman for the Berlin’s Public Prosecutor’s office. 
    

            The announcement comes in the middle of the band’s European stadium tour.
    

            Neither the band nor Lindemann have commented publicly since the investigation was launched on Wednesday, or responded to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            But a week ago, Rammstein’s lawyers Christian Schertz and Simon Bergmann denied the “serious accusations” against Lindemann which have surfaced across social media,  including an allegation that women at Rammstein concerts were drugged for “sexual acts.”
    

            The band’s lawyers have said such allegations are “without exception untrue” and warned that they would “take immediate legal action against the individual persons for all allegations of this nature.”
    

            That statement was deleted from their website after the prosecutor announced the investigation, according to the German Journalists Association.
    

            Concertgoers have accused Lindemann of coercion and systematic abuse of young women on social media in recent weeks.
    

            After a Rammstein concert in the Lithuanian capital on May 22, Irish fan Shelby Lynn alleged on social media that she had been drugged and also encouraged to drink, along with other young women selected from among concertgoers, and then brought to Lindemann for sex.
    

            In a series of tweets, Lynn said she declined Lindemann’s alleged advances but had no memory of later parts of the night and was ill and bruised the following day. 
    

            “I was spiked at the concert, only had 2 drinks at pre party,” Lynn also wrote on Instagram, showing pictures of large bruises on her body. “I don’t know when this happened or how,” she added.
    

            After Lynn’s account went viral, Rammstein rejected the allegations as false in a May 28 tweet: “With regard to the allegations circulating on the internet about Vilnius, we can rule out the possibility that what is being claimed took place in our environment.”
    

            On its website, the band urged fans and the public not to pre-judge them, saying they wanted their fans to “feel comfortable and safe at our shows - in front of and behind the stage.”
    

            A spokesman for Rammstein’s communications agency told CNN, “We can almost certainly rule out the possibility that spiking has occurred.”
    

            Lynn later clarified Lindemann didn’t touch her after she declined further advances from the singer. “I’d like to clarify again. Till did NOT touch me. He accepted I did not want to have sex with him. I never claimed he raped me,” Lynn said in a tweet on May 30.
    

            Lynn did not respond to CNN’s attempts to contact on her through social media.
    

            After Lynn went public with her account, German Youtuber Kayla Shyx, 21, released a video revealing details about her experience at a Rammstein concert in Berlin the previous year.
    

            In the 36-minute video, Shyx claimed she and other young women were recruited by an employee of the band to provide sexual services for the group’s leader following a concert on June 4, 2022.
    

            Shyx said the employee selected her and other young women to attend a party after the show, adding that the young women were asked to hand over their phones for “privacy reasons.”
    

            “I didn’t realize I was being recruited to be a part of such an orgy,” Shyx said, saying she later became aware that girls were recruited at every concert and directed to parties where they were vulnerable to unwanted physical encounters.
    

            In response to CNN’s request for comment, Shyx’s representatives offered no further information.
    

            In the wake of the controversy, publishing house Kiepenheuer & Witsch (KiWi), which publishes Lindemann’s work, terminated its cooperation with the author and band leader.
    

            “From our point of view, Till Lindemann exceeds immutable boundaries in dealings with women,” KiWi said, adding that their “relationship of trust with the author has been irretrievably broken.”
    

            Rammstein is continuing its Europe tour with concerts in Switzerland followed by gigs in Spain, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, Germany, Austria, Poland and Belgium.
    

            The band is scheduled to perform in Berlin on July, 15, 16 and 18, with all concerts sold out.
    

            Berlin’s Interior Senator Iris Spranger has prohibited after-show parties on public premises as a precaution, tweeting “In Berlin, there will be no aftershow parties of Rammstein in properties for which I am responsible. It is necessary to wait for the investigations, but the accusations weigh so heavily that protection and safety of women have absolute priority.” 
    

            The band appeared in the US in 2022, where they made stops in Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities, finishing the Americas Tour with three concerts in Mexico City.

He is accused of the murders of four cavalry members
The cavalry members and 7 horses were killed as they traveled through Hyde Park
""There is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction,"" said prosecutors

            A man has been charged with the murders of four members of the Royal Household Cavalry in a 1982 IRA attack in London, the UK Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement Wednesday.
    

            The suspect is named as John Anthony Downey, 61, of County Donegal, Ireland. 
    

            The four cavalry members were killed in London’s Hyde Park on July 20, 1982, as they rode from their barracks to Buckingham Palace. Seven horses were also killed.
    

            Downey is accused of the murders of Roy John Bright, Dennis Richard Anthony Daly, Simon Andrew Tipper and Geoffrey Vernon Young, a Crown Prosecution Service statement said.
    

            He’s also charged with intending to cause an explosion likely to endanger life.
    

            “We have determined that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction and that these charges are in the public interest,” said Sue Hemming, head of Special Crime and Counter-Terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service.
    

            Downey made an initial court appearance, at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, on Wednesday afternoon.
    

            In 1987, IRA member Gilbert “Danny” McNamee was ordered jailed for 25 years for making the bomb. The conviction was later overturned, and McNamee was freed.
    

            The Good Friday peace deal in 1998 largely brought to an end three decades of violence over the question of whether Northern Ireland should stay under British control or join the Republic of Ireland, as republicans want.

Top seeds Murray, Kerber also win
Halep upset by No. 52 Rogers

            Roger Federer glided around the court as if he had never been away, each shot eroding any hopes Jurgen Melzer had of ending one of tennis’s most anticipated comebacks prematurely.
    

            Federer, playing in his first official match after a six-month injury break, slammed 46 winners in a 7-5 3-6 6-2 6-2 defeat of the Austrian qualifier on the first day of the

            “This year hasn’t been so tough yet, last year was tough,” Federer joked during a court-side interview at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne.
    

            Earlier in the day, top seeds Angelique Kerber and Andy Murray were both given a workout in the Australian heat as they overcame tough Ukrainian opponents to reach the second round.
    

            “It’s nice to be playing normal tennis again on a center court like this, it’s beautiful,” Federer said. 
    

            “Couldn’t be happier I am here now. It was a long road and I made it. I’m in the draw which is a beautiful thing and I hope I can stick around for a little bit. First rounds are never easy for anybody, just happy I live another day.”
    

      
      

      

    

            The former top-ranked Swiss, the winner of 17 majors including four Australian Open titles, and 2010 French Open semi-finalist Melzer first played each other when they were juniors. 
    

            

    

            Now both 35 years of age and recently having overcome surgery – Federer on his knee a year ago and Melzer on his shoulder in 2015 – the Swiss was in command for most of the match. 
    

            Firing off 19 aces and rushing to the net 24 times, Federer was  at times so dominant, he even won 16 points in a row from 4-5 in the first set. 
    

            His concentration lapsed in the second set, which he lost despite leading 3-1.
    

            He then quickly restored order as he won the next two sets in just under an hour with attacking play that had the crowd roaring with delight at times.
    

            

    

            Competing in his 18th Australian Open, Federer faces another qualifier, 200th-ranked American Noah Rubin, in the second round. 
    

            Meanwhile on Hisense Arena, Swiss No. 1 and former Australian Open former champion Stan Wawrinka overcame a five-set scare against Martin Klizan, 4-6 6-4 7-5 4-6 6-4.   
    

            There was a controversial moment in the match, as reigning US Open winner Wawrinka drilled a blistering forehand into Klizan standing at the net which had the Slovak doubling up in agony.
    

            

    

            Defending champion Kerber of Germany squandered a match point in the second set before battling past 51st-ranked Lesia Tsurenko, 6-2 5-7 6-2.
    

            “First rounds are always tough,” Kerber said in a televised court-side interview. “But I always enjoy it here.”
    

            Kerber’s ascent to the top of the women’s rankings started a year ago in Melbourne, when she came back from a match point down in the opening round to win the tournament.
    

            She knocked 22-time major singles winner Serena Williams off the top spot after winning her second major of the season at the US Open in September. 
    

            Murray, who overtook defending Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic as the world No. 1 at the end of last season, overcame Illya Marchenko in three close sets.
    

            Britain’s Murray, seeking his first Australian Open title after five finals defeats, prevailed 7-5 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 against the 95th-ranked Marchenko as temperatures rose to as high as 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit).
    

            “I didn’t move that well,” Murray told reporters after the match. “That’s how it felt anyway. But sometimes that can also be down to the conditions, as well.
    

            “The ball’s flying through the air a little bit quicker, so the ball is coming onto you faster than what it was the last few days. Maybe wasn’t reacting as quickly as I would have liked.” 
    

            

    

            Earlier, American Shelby Rogers – world No. 52 – pulled off the biggest shock of day one so far when she upset the fourth-seeded Romanian Simon Halep, 6-3 6-1. 
    

            Halep told reporters later on she had been struggling with tendinitis on her knee which hampered her movement.

            So far, 8,700 tickets have been sold for the game at Exeter’s Sandy Park, the highest number for a women’s game on English soil outside the World Cup.  
    

            The Red Roses have won all three of their games in this year’s Six Nations with resounding victories over Wales, France, and Ireland all yielding four-try bonus points.

            Williams has talked about feeling “devastated” after her involvement in a car accident that led to the death of a 78-year-old man last month.

            Williams has now reached two grand slam semifinals in a season for the first time since 2007, having finished runner-up to younger sister Serena – who is pregnant and due to give birth next month – at the Australian Open in January.

            Williams’ press conference following her first-round win had to be stopped temporarily when she wept fielding questions about the car accident. 
    

            The police report said the 37-year-old was “at fault for violating the right of way” of the second and other vehicle and the victims’ family has since filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her.

            It’s against that backdrop that Williams finds herself just two wins from claiming an eighth grand slam title and first since collecting her fifth Wimbledon crown nine years ago. This is remarkably her 20th visit to the grass at SW19.
    

            Standing in her way Thursday is home hope Johanna Konta, who became the first British woman to land in the semifinals at Wimbledon since Virginia Wade in 1978 when she outlasted French Open finalist Simona Halep 6-7 (2) 7-6 (5) 6-4 in two hours, 40 minutes. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Halep would have become the new No. 1 in the rankings Monday with a win but instead last year’s US Open finalist Karolina Pliskova will replace Angelique Kerber at top spot. Just like when they faced off in Miami in March, Halep couldn’t put away Konta when leading by a set and holding two serves at 5-4 in the second-set tiebreak. 
    

            In another absorbing women’s contest this fortnight, Konta and Halep truly dazzled. The Romanian second seed lost despite compiling 26 winners and only nine unforced errors. Konta, seeded sixth and armed with a potent serve, hit 48 winners. 
    

            Garbine Muguruza – defeated in the 2015 Wimbledon final by Serena – joined Venus in the semis with a comfortable 6-3 6-4 win over twice grand slam winner Svetlana Kuznetsova on Court 1. 
    

            Muguruza struggled with the pressure last month of having to defend her 2016 French Open title but with Roland Garros a thing of the past, now appears more free on court.
    

            The Spaniard dispatched Kerber in a high-quality tussle Monday with fill-in coach and 1994 Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez looking on. Her foe Thursday is the unseeded Magdalena Rybarikova, who beat CoCo Vandeweghe 6-3 6-3 in a match that began on Court 1 but ended indoors on Centre Court due to the rain. 
    

            Rybarikova – whose ranking slipped to 453rd this year following wrist and knee injuries – knocked out Pliskova in the second round.  
    

            In a men’s quarterfinal that didn’t start as planned Monday due to darkness, Novak Djokovic began proceedings on Centre Court by advancing in straight sets against unseeded Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 6-2 7-6 (5) 6-4.
    

            That, too, was under the roof as the rain surfaced in London following a week of mostly dry, hot conditions. 
    

            

    

            

    

            But be it because of an apparent shoulder injury that necessitated a medical timeout, the scheduling, condition of the court or crowd backing his opponent, the three-time winner didn’t appear entirely pleased Tuesday. 
    

            He now faces a quick turnaround, meeting 2011 finalist Tomas Berdych on Wednesday. 
    

            Djokovic wasn’t asked about his shoulder or the crowd but did take a swipe at organizers for not putting him on court Monday.
    

            He was originally scheduled to feature last on Court 1 but was pushed back when Gilles Muller and Rafael Nadal spent five hours battling on court. 
    

            Meanwhile, play on Centre Court ended about 7 p.m. local time so Djokovic and Mannarino could have been moved to the main showcourt, which has the roof and lights. 
    

            “I think it was a wrong decision not to play us last night, because we could have played,” Djokovic told reporters
    

            “We went to the referee’s office before 8 p.m. There was security reasons. That was the only excuse, that basically there were explanations that we were getting.
    

            “I just didn’t see any logic in not playing us on the Centre Court.”
    

      
      

      

    

            Williams and Ostapenko on Centre was certainly logical. 
    

            In their first meeting, Williams set the tone against Ostapenko by breaking the Latvian in her first service game. Aided by that big serve, the lone break was enough to see Williams win the first. 
    

            Ostapenko can make unforced errors but this wasn’t an erratic performance, evidenced by her final tally of 20 winners and 18 unforced errors. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “She was playing good today, was serving well,” Ostapenko, making her Centre Court debut, said. “I think I didn’t start the match very well. I was missing a little bit. But, yeah, she was serving really well. 
    

            “It was very tough to break. Because of that I had more pressure because I had to keep my serve.”
    

            Williams repeatedly redirected Ostapenko’s fierce drives into corners to force errors. She delivered eight aces, perhaps none more important than when she trailed 4-5, 15-30 in the second set. 
    

            “Been working on that serve,” she said. “It’s working out for me just in time, just for these later rounds. I’d like to think that I can continue to rely on that as the matches continue.”
    

            Ostapenko – born 15 days before Williams made her Wimbledon debut in 1997 – clawed back a break deficit earlier in the second set but couldn’t recover from not breaking in the pivotal 10th game. 
    

            

    

            Williams duly broke for 6-5 and had no issues serving out the affair to record an 86th win at Wimbledon – the same as Serena.

            The fuel used in Formula One cars is 99% the same as the kind pumped into the hatchbacks, saloons or estate cars seen on roads all over the world. 
    

             So what, exactly, is in that missing 1% that makes elite motorsport so special?
    

            “That’s what I keep in my back pocket, I’m afraid,” Mike Evans, head of the fuel development program at Shell – which is supplier to the Ferrari team – told CNN’s The Circuit ahead of this weekend’s Hungarian Grand Prix.
    

            “This is the special treatment we give to the fuel, to make sure it gives the ultimate performance in the Ferrari engine, so unfortunately I’m sworn to secrecy on that one.”  
    

            As well as keeping their secret formula out of the public’s tanks, fuel suppliers also have to guard against curious rival companies.
    

            “We go to extreme extents (of secrecy),” Evans explains.
    

            “The fuel supplied is in our control the whole time, it’ll be stored in a truck in Europe or in a funded area at the races.  
    

      
      

      

    

            “There will be security over there, and after the race we arrange for what’s not been used to be disposed, locally adulterated, or returned sometimes back to our laboratory in Germany. 
    

            “I mean there is folklore – and I’ve never witnessed this – that people in the past used to go along and drill on the underside of the drum and get a sample out. 
    

            “Obviously on the top of the drum it looked great and then you’d suddenly realize it felt a bit light.
    

            “But those days are long since gone, so it is one of the things I would love to know how our fuels compare to our competitors’.”
    

            Much like athletes are subjected to drug tests before, during or after competitions, so too does the cars’ fuel undergo a similar process to ensure it complies with regulations.
    
 REPORT: Hamilton rocks, Perez rolls 
 
 

            The FIA, motorsport’s governing body, puts fuels through a rigorous test, while also regularly checking it over the course of a grand prix weekend.
    

            “They do this ‘blood’ test – the GC (Gas Chromatograph) test – on it, like a fingerprint of all the different compounds that are in the fuel,” Evans adds.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “The FIA are doing this ‘blood’ test to make sure that once the fuel has been approved, we don’t surreptitiously put this compound X in the fuel and then use it at the races.
    

            “They will come round twice over the race weekend. We monitor it from when we take the samples out of the drums, into the fueling rigs and into the car, to make sure that there’s no contamination.”
    

            The stakes are high for Evans and his team, as any mistake can have huge implications for Ferrari and its drivers throughout the championship.
    

            In 1997, Mika Hakkinen was stripped of his third place at the Belgium Grand Prix after the FIA ruled his fuel was not the correct formula.
    

            “You could be disqualified or you could get a big fine,” Evans said. “It’s bad news, basically. 
    

            “It would be the team and the driver who would get the penalty – so probably not Shell. 
    

            “If the team were fined, they would come and see us. The driver can face the penalty as well as the team, so we have to be very, very careful.”

            Less than six weeks after the national team’s remarkable performance at the World Cup, 
 finds itself at the center of world soccer as it hosts the FIFA Club 
.
    

            Since 2005 the Club World Cup has been held annually, featuring the six winners of each continent’s equivalent to Europe’s 
 tournament, plus an additional club from the host nation.
    

            Over the last decade, European teams have dominated the tournament, last losing a match when Brazilian club Corinthians beat Chelsea in the 2012 final. Fourteen-time European Cup winner Real Madrid will enter the 2023 competition as heavy favorites.
    

            Unlike the World Cup where there is a group stage, the clubs play a straight knockout tournament with the caveat that various continents qualify for different stages of the tournament.
    

            The champion of Oceania plays the host club in the first round. The winner is then drawn with the champions of Africa, Asia and North America in two knockout games. The winner of each game then plays the European and South American champions in the semifinals.
    

            Because Wydad Casablanca is both the champion of Morocco and Africa, the role of “host” passes to Egyptian club Al Ahly who lost to the Moroccan team in the final of the African Champions League in May.
    

            Wydad enters the tournament at the quarterfinal stage, playing against Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia with South American champion Flamengo waiting in the semifinals.
    

            Hunting a record fifth title, Real Madrid also enters at the semifinal stage and will face either New Zealand club Auckland City, Al Ahly, or the Seattle Sounders – the first ever US club to play in the Club World Cup.
    

            No African club has ever won the Club World Cup, but Wydad fan Mohamed Berrada is confident that in a tournament on home soil, the team can channel the success of its history-making national side – and perhaps even lift the trophy.
    

            “We had a very good World Cup with the national team in Qatar,” Berrada tells CNN Sports. “Everybody is talking about us, and we know that we will be very followed in this Club World Cup.”
    

            Expectations are high for the club with tickets for Wydad’s first match against Al Hilal selling out in under two hours as fans from Casablanca will make the one hour journey to Rabat’s 53,000 capacity Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium.
    

            Fans who regularly watch the English Premier League, La Liga, and the UEFA Champions League could be forgiven for asking the question: who cares about the Club World Cup? The European teams nearly always win, it adds extra fixtures to an already busy calendar, and fans have to watch their team play in far-flung countries.
    

            That sentiment is shared by some players. Manchester United great Paul Scholes once said on BBC Radio Five Live that the Club World Cup was less important to him than his local badminton tournament.
    

            But take a step outside Europe and the perception of the competition is very different.
    

            Flamengo fan João Paulo still views his team’s 3-0 triumph over Liverpool in 1981 in the Intercontinental Cup – a precursor to the Club World Cup – as the greatest moment in the club’s history.
    

            Despite Europe’s dominance in the tournament, it is still taken just as seriously in Brazil as it was 40 years ago.
    

            In 1981 Paulo listened to the match against Liverpool on the radio; in 2019, he made the trip to Qatar where Flamengo lost against the same opponent, and this year he is one of thousands of Flamengo fans making the trip to Morocco.
    

            “I believe that for us, for Brazilian and for South American supporters, winning the [Club] World Cup is something incredible. It’s amazing,” he tells CNN Sports. 
    

            “If we win this or if any team from South America can win this, this would be something that would change your life as a supporter.”
    

            It’s a sentiment is not limited to South America.
    

            Pitso Mosimane, who took Egyptian giants Al Ahly to back-to-back bronze medals in 2020 and 2021 and is arguably Africa’s greatest coach in the modern era, says the Club World Cup was the “highlight” of his career.
    

            “It’s the pinnacle of any club coach,” he tells CNN Sport.s “What’s the biggest tournament you want to play? Some would say the Champions League, but the Champions League leads you to the Club World Cup.”
    

            For Mosimane and others, the Club World Cup is the one chance that players, coaches, and fans get to test themselves against the very best.
    

            And even in a format that Mosimane says loads the dice in favour of Europeans and South American teams by allowing them to enter at the semifinals, the Club World Cup is the opportunity for fans of the Sounders, Al Ahly, Wydad and even Auckland City to earn the respect that Real Madrid has by dint of its geography.
    

            Those “loaded dice” are potentially on their last roll as Morocco’s tournament is the final Club World Cup to be held in its current format.
    

            Perhaps lost amidst the hysteria of Lionel Messi winning his first World Cup title was the announcement made by FIFA president Gianni Infantino that the Club World Cup would be turned into a 32-team tournament played every four years, starting in 2025.
    

            It is recognition from the head of world soccer that the tournament has not drawn the interest that the concept warrants. 
    

            With the tournament falling at the same time as the major leagues in Europe and just a few weeks ahead of the resumption of the Champions League, FIFA has recognized that it needs to both expand the tournament and find a time that does not clash with major club soccer.
    

            Soccer’s global governing body has not provided any information on the format of the tournament beyond the number of participants, but the announcement has caused quite a stir, particularly in Europe.
    

            The Premier League maintains its position that it is, “committed to preventing any radical changes to the post-2024 FIFA international match calendar that would adversely affect player welfare and threaten the competitiveness, calendar, structures and traditions of domestic football.”
    

            FIFPRO, the global player’s union, said that the tournament could have “serious consequences for and aggravate pressure on the welfare and employment of players.”
    

            However, Infantino’s idea has traction outside of Europe.
    

            “We would love to see our team playing against more and more international teams,” says Berrada.
    

            Moroccan journalist Amine El Amri agrees, bemoaning the “frustrating” model of the tournament now that gives the Europeans and South Americans an advantage over the other continents.
    

            He tells CNN Sports: “I think it’s just so enchanting for the people of those countries to have their countries in a [Club] World Cup.”
    

            Even in an expanded format, European clubs would arrive as heavy favorites and there are very real concerns about player welfare as the global soccer calendar mercilessly fills up.
    

            But for those outside of Europe, an expanded Club World Cup, if organized properly, is a potential opportunity for those seen as second-class clubs to take their place alongside European clubs at the top table of world soccer.

2014-03-20 11:05:00+00:00,,"Russian President Vladimir Putin announces the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region
Admonition, sanctions pour in from the West 

            Cheers in Moscow. Fear in Kiev. And jeers from the West.
    

            When Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region Tuesday and signed a formal decree, he made a major European crisis almost irreversible.
    

            His nation’s lawmakers wept and gave him a standing ovation in parliament as he  barraged the West for what he described as its numerous betrayals. But in Western capitals, there was no applause. Governments imposed sanctions on Russian leaders and warned that’s just the beginning.
    

            Here’s the rationalization for Putin’s decision, and the reasoning for the West’s derision. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            

    

            

    

            Former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. At the time, no one thought the Soviet Union would collapse, Putin said.
    

            It did. And Crimea was handed over “like a sack of potatoes,” 

    

            Now the people have spoken, and they want to be a part of Russia, Putin said, referring to a hastily-called weekend referendum on separating from Ukraine.
    

            “In our hearts, we know Crimea has always been an inalienable part of Russia,” 

    

            

    

            

    

            Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk called the annexation “a robbery on an international scale,” one that his nation will never accept. 
    

            President Barack Obama and other European allies have accused  Moscow of violating 

    

            Crimea, which has an ethnic Russian majority, 
. It had its own Parliament, but Ukraine had veto power over its actions.
    

            “One country has come and temporarily stolen part of the territory of an independent country,” Yatsenyuk said.
    

            —
    

            

    

            

    

            Ukraine’s new government, backed by the United States and European powers, prepared “to seize the state through terror and murders,” Putin said. What was Russia to do? he asked. 
    

            “The main executors of this were nationalists, Russia-phobes and anti-Semites,” he said. “Those people define what is happening today in Ukraine.”
    

            

    

            

    

            International observers said Moscow saw its chance to annex a strategic territory and took it. The region is pretty significant: It still hosts the home port of Russia’s Black Sea fleet.
    

            Putin is “mimicking the fascists of the last century” by annexing Crimea, Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov said. 
    

            And he has goals, some analysts say.
    

            “His project for his third term as President is to gather in as
 said Angela Stent, a professor at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. “Ukraine is the key to that project. And Crimea is the key to Ukraine.”

            The Russian leader accused the West of “double standards” in its response to the Crimean crisis, citing Kosovo’s split from Serbia. In 1999, NATO conducted a two-month bombing campaign to separate Kosovo’s Albanian population from the rest of Serbia. The United States supported the breakaway. 
    

            “It’s absolutely in favor of their own interests – black today, white tomorrow,” Putin said.
    

            He said anyone who would allow Kosovo to split from Serbia and not Crimea from Ukraine would be showing “absolute cynicism.”
    

            

    

            

    

            The United States said Russia’s justifications for taking Crimea amount to an attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty. 
    

            “President Putin today gave a speech rewriting history, and it only further put him on the wrong side of history,” U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said. 
    

            Preceding the 1999 NATO campaign, ethnic Albanians were being slaughtered. Crimea’s ethnic Russians were not facing the same prospect.

            Even though there are Russian troops and vehicles along the border, Putin says there are no plans to take any more territories from  Ukraine.  
    

            

    

            

    

            Ukraine stands at “the beginning of a very dangerous conflict, and we should do our best to stop this process,” said Petro Poroshenko, a former foreign minister and a leading potential candidate for President. 
    

            “Several weeks ago, we had a guarantee that nothing (would) happen with the Crimea,” he told CNN’s Christian Amanpour.  “Now under attack can be any country in the European Union, including other parts of Ukraine.” 
    

            — 
    

            

    

            

    

            U.S., Australian and EU officials imposed sanctions on more than two dozen Russian and Crimean officials. They include visa bans and frozen assets. 
    

            “President Putin should be in no doubt that Russia will face more serious consequences, and I will push European leaders to agree further EU measures when we meet on Thursday,”

    

            U.S. Vice President  Joe Biden said Russia faces more than just sanctions.  “We’re talking about Russia putting itself on a path that undermines long-term confidence and creates obstacles for its full participation in the global economy,” he said. “That path that they’ve placed themselves on does nothing to help the next generation of Russians compete and succeed in a world that will be led by the most dynamic and open economies.”
    

            But Stent said maintaining warm ties with the United States is not a priority for Putin. Russia’s granting of NSA leaker Edward Snowden asylum clearly shows that. 
    

            “Guaranteeing and expanding the Russian presence

            “We wait for sanctions,” deputy Prime Minister
. The message included a smiley face and a picture of  a black bear, vodka and a rifle. 
    

            Biographer Alexander Korobko said a country that can produce almost anything has no fear for sanctions. “It is absolutely not in the U.S. interest to impose sanctions on Russia, because who will take American astronauts to space if not us Russians?” Korobko asked.
    

            And the sanctions are a good indicator of how far this battle will go – or rather not go. 
    

            “The so-called smart sanctions … in response to events in Crimea
 on the part of the West to take the fight with Russia any further,” said Alexander Nekrassov, a former Kremlin adviser.

            After a member of its military was killed and more captured when masked gunmen seized their base near the Crimean regional capital, Simferopol, Ukraine’s defense ministry authorized its forces to open fire.
    

            It  warned that the crisis was shifting from political to military, and blamed it on Russia. 
    

            

    

            

    

            “If there were an armed conflict, neither the United States nor NATO would get militarily involved,” Stent said. “And the result could be the dismemberment of Ukraine and its division into two states on either side of a new East-West divide.” 
    

            Instead, the West should offer Ukraine’s interim government financial support and encourage it “not to let itself be provoked into a war with

            — 
    

            

    

            

    

            It’s not yet evident whether the sanctions will turn Russia into a pariah nation, but the U.S. has issued warnings to Moscow. 
    

            “Russia military intervention in Ukraine will only deepen Russia’s diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the Russia economy,” President Barack Obama said.
    

            

    

            

    

            Though condemned by the West, the Russian leader was at the height of his popularity hours after the annexation. Crowds gathered at the capital  to sing and dance. “Vladimir, Vladimir, we love you!” one woman said. “We bow to you.” 
    

            To some Russians, it symbolized a defeat against the West.

            Both the NBA’s Minnesota Timberwolves, who were set to play the Brooklyn Nets, and the NHL’s Minnesota Wild, who were facing the St. Louis Blues, postponed their Monday evening games. 
    

            
in Brooklyn Center over the fatal shooting that authorities say appeared to be the result of the officer mistaking a gun for a taser. Just ten miles away, a trial was being held for 
 in the death of another Black man, George Floyd.
    

            Outside of Minnesota, many teams, players and executives in professional sports acknowledged the death of Wright and the anger of the Minneapolis community. 
    

            “It just makes you sick to your stomach. How many times does it have to happen?” said Gregg Popovich, the coach of the San Antonio Spurs, ahead of a Monday game. “How many young Black kids have to be killed for no freaking reason?”
    

      
      

      

    

            The Spurs players linked arms with the Orlando Magic on Monday with bowed heads to honor Wright and respond to police brutality.
    

            Popovich called out Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, Donald Trump and other politicians for not doing enough to address gun violence in the US, calling the inaction “childish,” “sickening” and “dangerous.”
    

            “Do they want their grandchildren to go to work and go to school and go through these [mass shooter] drills and worry about being murdered? What does it take?” he said, adding that the response within police departments is limited by desires to maintain power as well.
    

            Doc Rivers, Philadelphia 76ers coach, spoke ahead of his team’s game to say that all Americans should be frustrated by the shooting.
    

            “We keep making mistakes on killing Black people. I don’t want to get into race but it’s there and I think we all have weaknesses and we all need to confront them and make this place a better world,” Rivers said.

            The Duke of Edinburgh, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, collided last month with another vehicle carrying two women, aged 28 and 45, as well as a nine-month old baby boy.
    

      
      

      

    

            While the 97-year-old emerged uninjured after the accident on a public road near the Queen’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, the 28-year-old suffered cuts to her knee while the 45-year-old sustained a broken wrist. The baby boy was unhurt.
    

            While the CPS did not identify Philip by name, the statement’s details matched the prince’s crash.
    

            “We have decided that it would not be in the public interest to prosecute,” it said.
    

            

    

            Philip gave up his driver’s license in the wake of the crash – after it became clear that he could be charged over it.
    

            A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said the prince “respects” the CPS decision, according to Britain’s Press Association.
    

            The CPS said it had considered “the level of culpability, the age of the driver and the surrender of the driving license” in its decision.
    

            After the accident, which occurred on January 17, pictures emerged showing Philip’s vehicle lying on its side with debris scattered around it. 
    

            Another image showed the vehicle had suffered major damage to the front left-side door – the opposite to where a driver sits in the UK – and much of the side. 
    

            Questions were raised at the time over whether the prince should still be driving. A royal source – who asked not to be named – said all procedures required to keep his license up to date had been followed.
    

            Philip retired from public life in 2017 after 
, during which he conducted more than 22,000 solo engagements and delivered nearly 5,500 speeches. 
    

            His retirement came more than five years after Buckingham Palace initially said he would commence scaling back his workload, though he remained eager to continue many of his duties. 
    

            Since taking a step back, Philip has been seen in public at a handful of events with the Queen and other members of the royal family, including last year’s weddings of

            As Andy Murray 
win at the US Open on Tuesday against Yoshihito Nishioka, small clusters of spectators took in the action on Arthur Ashe stadium. 
    

            They weren’t the usual paying fans, however, but rather support staff and players including Naomi Osaka, Dominic Thiem, Sofia Kenin and Grigor Dimitrov.  
    

            And where were the quartet watching from? Their own 
 that usually go to corporate sponsors of the tennis grand slam in New York. 
    

            With no fans on site due to the coronavirus pandemic, those suites – that cost on average $500,000 for the fortnight – have been allotted to all 32 seeded singles players and past US Open champions. 
    

            They’ve proved to be a big hit, too, replacing the locker room lounge as the players’ hang out area on site – at least for the elite – while they are still meant to be social distancing as part of the tournament’s bubble. 
    

            “To have it is a massive privilege,” 2017 finalist Madison Keys told reporters this week. “I know not everyone has that. Having a place that I can just go and there’s no one else and I can just sit there by myself is really nice.
    

            “I spend most of my time on-site there. I eat all my meals in there. I do a lot of my warmup in there. I stretch in there. I pretty much live in my suite,” she added with a laugh. 
    

            “I love that I can kind of peek out and see what’s going on on Arthur Ashe.”
    

            Serena Williams did just that on Tuesday, sticking around to catch older sister Venus’ first-round match in the night session. 
    

            It’s rare for tennis players to watch matches in stadiums. Their usual viewing while at events takes place in hotel rooms and in the player lounge. 
    

            Before his first round match, Murray gave viewers a tour of his own suite that featured a massage table, two TVs, fridges and a coffee machine that he said would go down well with his physiotherapist, Shane Annun.  
    

            “We’re normally in the locker room watching TV but I think we’ll be allowed to watch the matches on centre,” Murray, the 2012 winner, said correctly in a video put out by the US Open’s Twitter feed. “We basically got a bunch of seats. As you can see that’s Arthur Ashe Stadium,” he said, the court nearby.  
    

            “So we’ll be sitting out here watching matches, which is cool. We can order all of our food and drinks.”

 gives us a behind-the-scenes tour of his personal suite for this year's event. 

            The player Keys lost to in the 2017 final, Sloane Stephens, said the suites came complete with items now commonly associated with Covid-19 prevention. 
    

            “They have normal water, protective gear, all of the hand sanitizer, alcohol wipes, sanitizing stuff, masks, everything you could possibly think of,” Stephens told reporters. 
    

            “Then obviously we can order food from there. We just have our little QR code. You press what you want, it comes in like five minutes. You can order whatever you want.”
    

            Anything to improve upon? 
    

            “We can’t decorate the suite,” Stephens said light-heartedly. “That would have been cool. Other than that, everything in there that you need.”
    

            Had the suites been given out last year at the US Open, American Kenin still would have benefited being ranked 20th. 
    

            Now she’s ranked No. 4, after winning the Australian Open. She is the lone women’s grand slam winner this year following the postponement of Roland Garros and the cancellation of Wimbledon amid the pandemic. 
    

            “I have quite a big suite,” said Kenin. “It’s really comfortable there. I have a couch, TV, go outside on the balcony, watch practices on Ashe.
    

            “It’s a bit special. I’m really happy with the suites. It makes us feel a lot better. I’m really grateful for that.”
    

            Murray watched some of Alexander Zverev’s victory over 2017 finalist Kevin Anderson from his suite and said the seats were “brilliant.” 
    

            But for Murray, having other players keep an eye on him close up will take some getting used to. He reflected on the 2012 Olympics in London when he defeated Stan Wawrinka, with Wawrinka’s fellow Swiss Roger Federer in attendance. 
    

            “Federer was sitting in his box for that match. That was quite weird,” said Murray. “It was just a bit weird looking up and seeing him sitting in the players’ box when usually you look up and see kind of coaches and family and whatnot. He was there in his Swiss tracksuit and stuff.
    

            “He’s obviously one of the best players of all time, and he was just sitting in the box. I played well in that match, so I don’t want to say he put me off.
    

            “There’s not anyone I wouldn’t want to watch me, but definitely you feel certain players’ presence more than others maybe.”

            Covid-19 vaccines are coming, but in most of Europe, winter is coming faster. In several countries, cases are surging again — after many countries seemed to be turning the tide.
    

            Politicians are desperate to find a balance of restrictions that flatten the curve without flattening the economy or upsetting residents who are eager to reunite for the holidays.
    

            “The key question now is to determine what is the optimal package of policies to maximize the health benefit at least cost,” said Thomas Hale, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Oxford. “However, this ‘magic formula’ will likely differ across different countries and populations, and of course over time as the virus surges or recedes.” 
    

            It’s a complicated and ever-changing calculus, and every country is different. 
    

            But the approaches of three nations — Finland, Norway and Denmark — in recent months stand out, a CNN analysis shows.  The analysis, which looked at data from the University of Oxford and Johns Hopkins University, found that while all three countries implemented some of the continent’s most relaxed combinations of restrictions, they still managed to keep average daily deaths low — below one per million — for the three-month period between September 1 and November 30. 
    

            Denmark success may be ending. In late November, Danish death rates exceeded one per million for the first time since May, Johns Hopkins data shows. On Friday, the number of newly reported cases topped 4,000.  Earlier in the week, officials expanded restrictions and announced a nationwide lockdown aimed at tamping down rising infections.
    

            But what led to the three nations’ success in the fall?
    

            Denmark, Finland and Norway responded quickly to the slightest increase in infections, which allowed them to almost eradicate the virus during the summer and face the autumn from a stronger place, according to interviews with six scholars. Clear guidance and residents’ willingness to follow it was also key, the experts said. And ramping up testing and contact-tracing capacities and providing paid sick leave helped to keep any outbreaks localized.
    

            Finland had Europe’s lowest average of infections and deaths per capita in recent months, Johns Hopkins data shows.  It managed to contain local outbreaks while sticking to some of the most relaxed restrictions on the continent.  Internal movement was not restricted, those who needed to could attend school and workplaces in person, and mask-wearing was not mandatory. 
    

            “There is nothing magical about doing this — we just have a pragmatic approach,” said Pekka Nuorti, an epidemiology professor at Tampere University who has worked for public health agencies for more than 25 years. 
    

            Cultural, political and geographic factors — such as low population density, less travel and high trust in government — were helpful, Nuorti said, but it was the work of the country’s health agencies that made a difference. 
    

            During the summer, Finland built up “tried-and-true field epidemiology practices,” Nuorti said: Testing, isolating, contact tracing, quarantining and preventing superspreading events on a local level.
    

            The average daily testing volume nearly quadrupled from 2,900 samples in May to 11,300 in August, health ministry data shows.  In late November, Finnish laboratories performed up to 23,000 tests a day, or 90% of the current capacity.
    

            Finland used the summer to prepare for the new wave by responding with preventative measures instead of a lockdown, said Mika Salminen, director of health security at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare.  Restricting international travel for most of the summer added to Finland’s success in the fall, he said. 
    

            To help people isolate and stay home, the government provided economic support. Thousands of people who were exposed could quarantine because the government offered compensation for their lost income, Salminen said. 
    

            “It’s not that we haven’t had outbreaks,” Nuorti said.  Finland had local flare-ups and super spreader events, but local health authorities, coordinated by the central government, were able to contain them using real-time data, he said. But as case numbers rise, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify all transmission sources, Nuorti said. 
    

            If the situation deteriorates, Salminen said, a full lockdown has not been ruled out.
    

            Across the border, Norwegian officials increased their focus on addressing the most vulnerable. 
    

            Norway’s spring lockdown was the strictest in Scandinavia. The country’s oil and gas industry was able to provide a large economic buffer to soften the effect on people’s purses, but the government soon faced a growing mental health crisis and officials shifted their restrictions.
    

            Also, in late summer, 
. To adjust its communication strategy, 
 to fund a Covid-19 awareness campaign for the country’s immigrant population. These targeted interventions appeared to contribute to a notable drop in infection rates among those communities, said Jonathan Tritter, a professor of sociology and policy at Aston University.
    

            Three experts interviewed by CNN said a critical factor in Denmark’s early success was clear and coherent messaging about risks and the need for behavioral changes.  They attributed the country’s achievement to its history of mutual trust between residents and the government.
    

            “The government was able to activate that background of trust, the good default position, with effective communication,” said Michael Bang Petersen, a political psychology professor at Aarhus University who runs 
, a research study examining how people and governments are coping with the pandemic.
    

            Petersen said two factors determine whether people behave to avoid infection.  One is motivation: Whether they are worried about becoming infected.  The other is whether they know exactly what to do to prevent spreading the disease, which hinges on communication from health authorities and politicians, Petersen said. 
    

            One of the officials leading the Danish pandemic response echoed that point. 
    

            “Handling a pandemic is all about human behavior,” said Søren Brostrøm, general director of the Danish Health Authority. 
    

            Human behavior helps diseases spread, and controlling it is where solutions lie, Brostrøm said. Physical distancing, not a drug or vaccine, is the “medical magic bullet” everyone is hoping for, he said. 
    

            Brostøm spoke to CNN prior to Denmark’s recent surge in cases.  But at a press conference on Wednesday, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen addressed the country’s worsening situation. 
    

            “In the end, only one thing works against corona,” Frederiksen said. “That is if you and I and we all take responsibility for ourselves and for each other.”
    

            Multiple studies have concluded that lockdowns work. At Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government, scientists developed what they called a 
. The index rates about 180 countries and territories based on their restrictions, such as school closures and stay-at-home orders, on a scale of one to 100. Higher scores represent more stringent restrictions.
    

            In 
, the Oxford researchers found that in the spring, higher scores on their scale were associated with slower growth of daily deaths. On average, they found, a week’s delay in reaching medium stringency led to almost twice as many new deaths over the months that followed.
    

            But as pandemic fatigue seeps in, people become more reluctant to follow strict new measures, experts told CNN. 
    

            Constant social distancing is not sustainable in the long run, Brostrøm said. A country needs just enough restrictions to be able to control the pandemic. 
    

            “I think we found we actually struck quite a good balance in this country in this regard,” he said.
    

            Even in Denmark, one misstep can have a detrimental effect on trust and then compliance, experts said.
    

            A government decision to cull the country’s farmed mink over fears the animals could spread the coronavirus to humans is one example. After ordering the cull, 
.
    

            But the government’s overreach shook Danish unity, Petersen said.
    

            “Right now, we are seeing an increased polarization. We’re seeing decreased support of the government strategy. And the question that is facing us here in Denmark is, ‘What will be the consequences of that for the pandemic over the next months?’” Petersen said.
    

            Danish officials’ willingness to impose stricter measures when necessary stands in contrast to Sweden, where officials first took a lighter hand to try and stem the pandemic. 
    

            “There was a greater emphasis on voluntary measures, and without the extreme ‘shutdown’ measures put in place in Denmark (in the spring),” said Rowland Kao, a veterinary epidemiology professor at the University of Edinburgh.
    

            “Other Nordic countries are much more in line with the rest of Europe,” Kao said. “They had a stricter lockdown in spring and did it sooner.”
    

            Kao said this approach made Sweden’s uptick of cases in June, when most other European countries were recovering, inevitable. And in November, despite having a higher average stringency score than other Scandinavian countries, Sweden was struck by a nationwide outbreak.
    

            Addressing his nation in late November, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven 
.
    

            “When Covid-19 arrived in our country, we all agreed to take responsibility,” Löfven said. “This autumn, too many of us have neglected to follow the advice and recommendations.”
    

            When it comes to a disease that spreads so fast, Kao, the Edinburgh professor, said very small differences in how things are done can make all the difference in the world.
    

            For this story, we sought to examine the relationship between government restrictions and Covid-19 deaths during the period between September 1 and November 30, when many countries were in the throes of a resurgence. 
    

            To do so, we analyzed data from Johns Hopkins University to calculate the daily new deaths per million residents in 31 European countries. We used a moving average to account for variations in the data caused, for example, by delays in reporting on weekends, or changes in data collection methods that would otherwise result in a sudden spike in daily figures. We used new deaths instead of new cases because the reporting criteria for deaths is more consistent across countries than for cases, which is in part a function of testing volume. 
    

            We then plotted the new death rates against each country’s stringency score, which we found using Oxford University’s Stringency Index.  The index scores countries’ Covid-19 response measures on a scale of one to 100.
    

            We analyzed the 27 European Union members, the United Kingdom and free trade countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland). We then excluded Liechtenstein because stringency scores for that country were not available.
    

            Following interviews with experts, we defined countries with low infection rates as those with one or fewer death per million residents.  We defined less restrictive countries as those with stringency scores below 60 because it was roughly the minimum score for countries with full lockdowns in October and November according to data we compiled on European countries’ lockdown status at that time. 
    

            We focused on Finland, Norway and Denmark because those were the only countries to consistently maintain low death rates (one per million or less) and stringency scores below 60 during the September 1 to November 30 period. Other countries also maintained low death rates, but we did not focus on them because they either implemented a strict lockdown (Ireland) or had a high stringency score (Cyprus).

            Masters champion Jordan Spieth kept his nerve to claim the U.S. Open title Sunday in a dramatic finish at Chambers Bay.
    

            Spieth had birdied the final hole to finish on five-under 275, but then watched as fellow American Dustin Johnson three-putted from 12 feet on the 18th to finish one shot behind, tied with South African Louis Oosthuizen for second.
    

            Johnson’s eagle putt for outright victory on the par-five closing hole went adrift, and he then missed the short four-foot birdie putt which would have forced a playoff on Monday.
    

            The 21-year-old Spieth is the youngest U.S. Open champion since Bobby Jones in 1923 and only the sixth man in history to win this title and the Masters in the same year, Tiger Woods being the last in 2002.
    

      
      

      

    

            He is now halfway to the grand slam, with the British Open at St. Andrews and U.S. PGA Championship to come later in the year.
    

            “I feel for Dustin,” Spieth said. “I’m still amazed that I won, let alone that we weren’t playing tomorrow.
    

            “We’re going to go to St. Andrews looking for the Claret Jug. I believe we can get it done if we get the right prep in,” he added.
    

      
      

      

    

            Former British Open champion Oosthuizen charged through the back nine in 29 shots for a 67 to set a testing clubhouse target of four-under 276.
    

            Joint overnight leader Branden Grace, tied in the lead with Spieth at five-under playing the 16th, made a double bogey to end his hopes and the eventual champion pulled three shots clear as he birdied.
    

            But Spieth then showed his first signs of fallibility by making an ugly double bogey five on the short 17th, before recovering with a battling birdie on the 18th.
    

            Australian Jason Day, so brave in fighting off vertigo in rounds two and three, fell away to finish on level par after starting the final round tied with Spieth, Johnson and Grace on four-under.
    

            Two earlier starters had threatened to turn the tournament on its head, with world number one Rory McIlroy moving to two-under-par when he rolled home a monster 72-foot birdie putt on the 13th.
    

            It took the Northern Irishman to six-under for the day, but he missed a short birdie opportunity on the next and then frittered two shots away to close with a 66 and level par.
    

            Aside from McIlroy, an even bigger threat emerged as former Masters champion Adam Scott, with Woods’ old caddy Steve Williams on his bag, was quietly moving up the leaderboard.
    

            When he birdied the final hole for a best-of-the-week 64, Scott had set a challenging three-under 277 total, good enough for a tie for fourth with South African Grace and fellow Australian Cameron Smith.

            He spends most of his time in his native Slovenia but jumped at the opportunity to represent Kosovo. 
    

            “When I started skiing, Kosovo was not an independent country,” he was quoted as saying by 
. “My father always cheered for Kosovan athletes and I did it as well, so when Kosovo proclaimed independence I wanted to help by representing the country as an athlete.”
    

            Like Abeda, the 28-year-old Tahiri is Kosovo’s first winter Olympian and its flag bearer. He’ll be busy on the slopes, scheduled to compete in all five alpine events. 
    

            His participation marks another step on the sporting ladder for Kosovo, which earned its first ever Olympic gold medal through wrestler Majlinda Kelmendi in Rio two years ago and recently concluded its first ever qualifying campaign for football’s World Cup. 
    

            

    

            
 
    

            Like it or not, Callister may forever be known as a relative of Vegemite creator Cyril Callister. According to the PyeongChang 2018 website, the latter was his great uncle. 
    

            For those not in the know, the yeast extract spread was invented in Australia to rival a similar product – Britain’s Marmite – and became a hit. So much so that the 
 Vegemite as a “symbol” of the nation. 
    

            “In the 1950s, Vegemite spoke of Australian vitality and innocence,” wrote the NMA. “Today it provides a connection back to seemingly simpler times and is symbolic of the reverence for the ordinary in Australian culture.”
    

            Kent Callister was born in San Diego to an Australian father, moved to Australia, then returned to the US. He chose to represent Australia after 
 from its Olympic Winter Institute. 
    

            The 22-year-old made a splash in Sochi four years ago, finishing ninth in the halfpipe and has been ranked as high as fourth although he is currently 43rd in the standings. 
    

            

    

            When South Korea battles Canada in men’s ice hockey on Feb. 18, the game is sure to take on added significance for half-a-dozen members of the home team: They were all born in Canada but are playing for South Korea, having become naturalized. 
    

            Goalie Dalton is one of the bunch. He figures to be busy, yet not as busy as he might have initially expected since 
 no NHLers on site. 
    

            South Korea’s head coach is Jim Paek, who was the first South Korean to play in the NHL. He won two Stanley Cups with the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
    

            Paek insisted there was nothing wrong with the native Canadians being on the team. 
    

            “They’ve been here longer than I’ve been here,”

            Williams – Brazil’s first ever Olympic figure skating entrant in Sochi in 2014 – is one of nine athletes on the South American nation’s team. 
    

            The 22-year-old was born and resides in the US – currently attending New Jersey’s Montclair State University – but her mom is Brazilian. 
    

            Williams told MSU’s student newspaper she is intent on improving from her 30th place finish in Sochi. 
    

            “My first Olympics did not go as well as I had hoped,” she said. “It kind of sucked working towards something and it not going as well as you’d hoped. It was three minutes, but it felt like my whole skating career was over. 
    

            

    

            “But I decided to get back into skating, and I’m just happy to have another chance to perform to my potential.”

2011-09-20 14:50:00+00:00,,"In 1845 Sir John Franklin and 129 men set out on a mission to map the Northwest Passage
160 years of searching have failed to find the lost ships ""HMS Erebus"" and ""HMS Terror""
The last known account of the expedition was in 1848

            It’s been described as one of the greatest Victorian gothic horror stories of all time. Two ships with 129 men on board and fitted with the latest technology, vanish with barely a trace left behind. One hundred and sixty years of searching – one attempt as recent as last month –  have failed to find “HMS Erebus” and her sister ship, the somewhat appropriately named “HMS Terror” – the two vessels lost in the Arctic.
    

            In 1845 British Royal Navy captain Sir John Franklin set out with some of the finest sailors of the time on a mission to map the Northwest Passage. Franklin’s expedition wasn’t the first to the region, but it is the most infamous.
    

            “Why did this fail when all the others didn’t,” asks author 
 “There was something jinxed about the expedition.” Battersby is one of many to be transfixed by the mystery of Franklin’s last voyage. “We love adventure stories, of derring-do, win against all odds, but in this story they don’t and we still don’t know why.”
    

            The environment of the Northwest Passage is unforgiving. The landscape is vast and deserted, comparable only to Jupiter’s moons. The winters are unrelenting and bleak. Franklin’s men were faced with particularly brutally harsh temperatures and blizzards when they reached the region. 
    

            Despite the ships being reinforced with steel and holding three years worth or provisions, it appears the environment got the better of the crew. “Man proposes, God disposes,” says Bob Headland from the 
, who regularly visits the region. ‘“And the ice gods are a fickle lot.”
    

        It’s an incredible story. It’s got shipwrecks, the remoteness of the Arctic, putting the might of English industrialism against Mother Nature
    

            Ryan Harris
        

            The disappearance of the Erebus and the Terror has prompted the longest search mission in history: Although there have been numerous attempts to find the ships, there has been no sign of them. 
    

            Ryan Harris from
 led the most recent mission to try to locate the shipwrecks. Last month, his crews spent hours scouring the ocean floor, searching waters up to 50 meters deep. “It’s an incredible story. It’s got shipwrecks, the remoteness of the Arctic, putting the might of English industrialism against Mother Nature,” says Harris.
    

            Since 1997 Parks Canada has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars attempting to locate the “Erebus” and “Terror.” The tale of the Franklin expedition has enthralled Canadians – the wreckage has the dubious honor of being the only national historic site in Canada that hasn’t been found yet.
    

            “Once Franklin received his orders that sealed his fate,” Harris explains. “In directing them south-west into ultimately the Victoria Strait it took them to the ice choke point. Once they fell into the clutch of that area, their fate was sealed. There’s not much wildlife there and it is isolated.”
    

            The last known account of the “Erebus” and “Terror” came in 1848. A rock cairn with a message on it indicated that the harsh conditions had already claimed their first lives, with only 105 men left alive. 
    

         “These are the last of the ghost ships. It is the world’s biggest ghost story.”

    

            William Battersby
        

            Franklin was one of the first casualties of his own expedition. That same year the men abandoned their ships, archaeologists believing they began making their way south in a desperate bid to find food. 
    

            However the harsh environment supported little, and with few animals to hunt and over 100 men to feed, the chance of survival was low. It’s been suggested that the men may have resorted to cannibalism in their last-ditch efforts to survive. “There were far too many men to live off the environment. What man plans and what nature allows are two different things,” says Headland.
    

            Archaeologists have relied heavily upon oral Inuit history to try to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Based on their accounts it is thought some of the men lived for another three or four years after abandoning ship.
    

            But questions remain over exactly what happened to them. In 160 years only two skeletons and three perfectly preserved bodies have been uncovered. It is likely diseases such as scurvy claimed many lives but Battersby believes it may have been the ships themselves that killed the sailors. 
    

            His theory is that the men succumbed to lead poisoning derived from the internal pipe system used to melt ice into drinking water. It’s hoped the discovery of the ships will provide answers.
    

            ‘“There’s a charm to the story,” acknowledges Harris. “By solving a mystery it takes the allure away.” But having said that, Harris is determined the search will go on until the “Erebus” and the “Terror” are found. Parks Canada insists that their searches have not been futile and they’ll continue to gather information to help with future efforts. “I hope we’re the last,” says Harris.
    

            But after 160 years it’s possible that this tale may be frozen in time forever. “These are the last of the ghost ships,” says Battersby. “It is the world’s biggest ghost story.”

            Billy McNeill, the first Briton to lift the European Cup when Celtic won the competition with a team of homegrown players in 1967, has died at the age of 79.
    

            Nicknamed “Cesar” by the clubs fans, McNeill captained the Celtic team that defeated Inter Milan 2-1 in Lisbon in 1967, the first and only time a Scottish team has won European football’s most coveted club prize.
    

            He appeared 790 times for the Glasgow club, winning nine league titles, seven Scottish cups and six league cups. McNeill also had a successful managerial career during two spells as Celtic boss. He managed Manchester City, Aston Villa and Aberdeen as well, where he was replaced by Alex Ferguson in 1978.
    
Rest in peace, Cesar. You’ll Never Walk Alone. 

            A 
 on Celtic’s website Tuesday read: “The Celtic Family is mourning the death of Billy McNeill, the club’s greatest ever captain and one of the finest men to have played and managed the Hoops.”
    

            “Billy McNeill was a Celtic player, manager and ambassador. First and foremost, however, he was always a Celtic supporter and his love for the club was evident throughout his life.
    

            “He was a one-club man as a player and, for Billy, that club had to be Celtic. He spent 18 years at the club, joining in 1957 and bowing out in 1975. He made his first-team debut on August 23, 1958 in a 2-0 home win over Clyde in the League Cup, while his final appearance came on May 3, 1975 when he captained Celtic to a 2-1 victory over Airdrie in the Scottish Cup final.”
    
Billy McNeill, 
 & 
 legend, has died at the age of 79.
In 1967, he became the first British man to lift the European Cup - one of a staggering 3⃣1⃣ major trophies he won with Celtic as player and manager 👏 
 

            Current Celtic manager Neil Lennon 
 : “When you think of Celtic and our incredible history, Billy McNeill is always one of the first names that comes to mind. He was our greatest ever captain and one of our greatest ever players, and along with his team-mates, achieved historic things for Celtic in the 1960s and ’70s.”
    

            Celtic fan and rock star Rod Stewart tweeted: “Hail Hail Cesar! Farewell my friend, Billy McNeill, and farewell one of the best Celts ever. “
    

            A statue of McNeill, arms aloft, holding the European Cup greets visitors to Celtic Park. The European Cup winning team, all of whom were born within 30 miles of the club’s stadium, became known as the “Lisbon Lions” and is one of only a handful of European teams to win four trophies in one season.
    
Hail Hail Cesar! 
Farewell my friend, Billy McNeill, and farewell one of the best Celts ever. - XXX Rod 

            As well as the continental triumph, McNeill is idolized by Celtic fans for securing a dramatic league and cup double for the club as manager in its 1988 centenary season.
    

            McNeill had reportedly been suffering from ill health in recent years with his family revealing he had dementia in 2017.
    

            A 
 from the McNeill family on Tuesday acknowledged the struggles of his latter years and said that “he fought bravely to the end, showing the strength and fortitude he always has done throughout his life.”
    
Billy McNeill was 
 's captain during its most glorious era in the 1960s and 70s, winning 9 consecutive Scottish leagues and 13 tournaments. The team will be remembered for one of the greatest achievements in history, the 1967 European Cup. 🏆 
 

            Just last week, McNeill was awarded Athletic Bilbao’s “One Club Man” award for his commitment and loyalty to Celtic throughout his playing career.
    

            Jim Craig, a former teammate of McNeill and fellow “Lisbon Lion,” 
: “Heartbroken over the passing of my great friend and captain Billy McNeill.”
    
Our thoughts are with the family and friends of former Scotland and 
 captain Billy McNeill, a true icon of Scottish football.
We will not see his likes again. 

            Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon 
 McNeill “a giant of Scottish football.”
    

            Former Manchester United manager, Alex Ferguson, who went up against McNeill as a player and a coach, 
 him as a “truly good man” who will be “a loss to everyone who knew him. Farewell Cesar.”
    

            Comedian and Celtic fan, Frankie Boyle 
: I talked to Billy McNeill in his pub a couple of times, and it was quite something to be in the presence of someone who was a very ordinary, gentlemanly kind of character, and simultaneously a kind of mythic figure. Rest in Peace.

 depleted squad managed to cling on to a narrow 1-0 win away to Real Mallorca to begin the new year with a victory and edge closer to the Champions League qualification places.
    

            After a torrid start to the season, during which Barça lingered in the bottom half of the table, new head coach Xavi has slowly started to right the ship with just one defeat in seven La Liga matches.
    

            It has been far from pretty at times – Barcelona needed last-minute heroics from goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen to preserve the three points against Mallorca – but putting points on the board is all that matters during this rocky transitional period.
    

            Ter Stegen’s importance to the team was encapsulated in the 91st minute on Sunday with a stunning one-handed save from Jaume Costa’s close-range effort, leading Barcelona defender Eric García to eulogize that Barcelona “owes 70 percent of the win to Ter Stegen.”
    

            

    

            “He was spectacular and he’s a top goalkeeper,” García told Movistar TV. “We know he responds in moments like that. 
    

            “Mallorca were pressing and we knew we had to soak it up and we’ve shown we are able to do that.”  
    

            The win moves Barça into fifth place, just one point behind Atlético Madrid in the fourth and final Champions League spot.
    

            It was a good weekend all around for the

            Real suffered a shock defeat away to struggling Getafe, with Enes Ünal’s ninth-minute goal the difference between the two sides.
    

            Despite dominating possession and forcing Getafe goalkeeper David Soria to make numerous impressive saves, Real head coach Carlo Ancelotti was far from pleased with his side’s performance.
    

            “There’s not a lot to say about the game, we stayed on holiday for an extra day,” Ancelotti told reporters. “We weren’t the same team that ended the year.
    

            “We were less focused and less committed. A draw would have been fair because we didn’t deserve to lose, but we gifted a goal and we lost. It should be a wake-up call.”
    

            However, the result wasn’t damaging for Real’s La Liga title hopes as 
 still boast an eight-point lead over second place Sevilla, which has two games in hand on the league leader and plays later on Monday.

            If a New Year heralds a fresh start, then for Christian Wade – who has left a prolific rugby career for a shot at the NFL – January 2019 will be more of a leap into the unknown.  
    

            “I’ve never played it,” he confesses, “just watched as a fan and admired from afar.”  
    

            American football has a long history of welcoming players from different athletic backgrounds, or of watching players leave to pursue opportunities in another sport. Few cross-code players, however, have pedigree quite like Wade.
    

            For the past eight years, he’s established himself as one of rugby’s most explosive talents and, at the age of 27, showed no signs of slowing down.
    

            His elusive speed enabled him to run rings round defenders, accumulating a highlights reel of tries that would be the envy of some of the game’s most potent attackers.
    

            Scoring always came naturally to Wade, whose 82 Premiership tries for English side Wasps put him third in the league’s all-time list, just 10 shy of a record he seemed nailed-on to surpass.  
    

            None of this, of course, escapes the former winger, who a few weeks ago cut short his club contract to pursue a career in the NFL. 
    

            “I just felt I needed a new challenge,” he tells CNN Sport. “I felt like I had come to a point where something like the NFL was a great opportunity and something I believe I can do well in.”
    

            Wade would become the third English rugby player to sign for an NFL franchise if he gets selected through the International Player Pathway Program, which gives teams an extra spot in their practice squads for players from outside the US.
    

            
, who captained Wade at England under-20 level, is over a year into his journey with the Atlanta Falcons, while 
, who attended the same high school as Wade, is playing with the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
    

            Both, however, left rugby at an earlier age than Wade, who knows he has a mountain to climb in what can be a ruthless process. 
    

            “Speaking to Christian, he’s saying he’s seen players that are there on the Monday and come the Wednesday afternoon they’re not in training because they’ve been cut,” says Wade. “It’s so cut-throat – you don’t know what’s going to happen.
    

            “The next six weeks for me are about building strength, power and speed. 
    

            “In rugby you have to be prepared to run like 7 km a game and within that do lots of different things. The NFL requires you to be able to go 100% and be explosive and powerful and quick in short bursts with limited time to recuperate.”
    

            With a block of NFL-based training under his belt, Wade will head to Florida in January for a three-month training camp where intensive 17-hour days await.
    

            “We will obviously be training hard again,” he says, “but it will be more centered around learning football – learning plays and terminology, learning the playbook, learning what a professional athlete’s lifestyle is going to be like in the NFL.”
    

            Amazon’s “All or Nothing” series has piqued Wade’s interest in gridiron, and when he speaks enthusiastically about the likes of Tyreek Hill, Saquon Barkley, and Odell Beckham Jr.,it’s clear he intends to impress with his agility Stateside. 
    

            Cynics would point to the big pay packets at the top of the NFL as motivation for a newcomer to the sport, but practice squad players are 
 to earn a base salary of $129,000. 
    
As 
 announces his retirement from rugby, here's a look at some of his best moments 😍
Thanks for the memories 🙌 Which one of these terrific tries is your favourite? 👇 

            Wade knows that, in leaving rugby, he’s sacrificing security. 
    

            “I’ve got good money coming in, I’m a regular starter for my team, I’ve got potential to go abroad and earn more money and stuff,” he says.
    

            “But for me it’s never really been about the money as such. It’s about enjoyment first. Pushing my body, testing myself – all that will come with it.”
    

            If enjoyment is a priority, then the suggestion is that some of rugby’s early appeal has faded. 
    

            Wade made his England debut in 2013 having scored 13 tries in the Premiership season, and soon afterward was called up to the British and Irish Lions tour in Australia. 
    

            What appeared to be a blossoming international career, however, was short-lived as Wade fell out of favor with then-England coach Stuart Lancaster. His first cap was also his last. 
    

            “It was frustrating,” he says, “but at the end of the day it’s one man’s opinion … When opinions are formed it’s hard to change them. 
    

            “I’ve always been scoring tries, I’ve always been top try scorer [in the league] or top three every season. That’s been a given for me. Maybe there’s something else they were looking for.” 
    

            At only 5ft 8in, the notion that Wade was just too small for international rugby was often cited, or that his defensive qualities paled in comparison to his attacking prowess. 
    

            He became accustomed to putting such criticism aside, but you get the impression it kept niggling away even when the disappointment of several England omissions were behind him.  
    

            And at a time when players are getting bigger and thumping collisions are becoming more common, does Wade think rugby will cease to be a game for the small guy? 
    

            “I don’t know, it’s hard to say,” he muses. 
    

            “Some people will say it’s not for individuals of all shapes and sizes or whatever but you still see there’s players out there who are dominating. You’ve got Cheslin Kolbe for South Africa, [Nehe] Milner-Skudder playing for New Zealand. There’s still players out there who are small.
    

            “For me, it’s always been that it doesn’t matter what size or shape you are. If you’re there to do a job and you’re doing it well then there’s no reason why you shouldn’t get picked.”
    

            If Wade really has played his last ever game of rugby, then one sport’s loss is another’s gain. But he refuses to make any guarantees on his future, admitting he’d be open to a return to rugby – perhaps to chase that Premiership try record. 
    

            “Rugby’s wicked, man,” he says. “I’ve loved it since I was 15 or 16. It’s been really good to me.
    

            “I appreciate everything from my rugby career but it’s a new chapter now. Obviously it’s a lot of work and those 17-hour days definitely make me nervous.

            Megan Jacobs, a researcher at the University of Portsmouth and a PhD student at Baylor University, Texas, who has spent years working on ichthyosaurs, identified it as a new genus and species. 
    

            The two-meter long ichthyosaurus, which lived 150 million years ago, has been named the “Etches sea dragon” (Thalassodraco etchesi).
    

      
      

      

    

            Etches said in a press release published by the University of Portsmouth Wednesday that he was honored the discovery was named after him.
    

            “It’s excellent that new species of ichthyosaurs are still being discovered, which shows just how diverse these incredible animals were in the Late Jurassic seas,” Etches added.
    

            Scientists have now identified five species of ichthyosaur from the Late Jurassic period in the UK.
    

            They are known as sea dragons because of their usually large teeth and eyes.
    

            Fossils of ichthyosaurs from this period are rare, according to Jacobs, but this one was well-preserved because it settled in a very soft seafloor when it died.
    

            This meant the front part of its body sunk into the mud, protecting it from scavengers that ate the tail end.
    

            “Thalassodraco etchesi is a beautifully preserved ichthyosaur, with soft tissue preservation making it all the more interesting,” said Jacobs in the press release.
    

            Ichthyosaurs were highly adapted marine predators with big eyes, streamlined bodies and lots of conical teeth for catching fish.
    

            The newly identified species has a deep ribcage, small flippers and smooth teeth, which mark it out from other ichthyosaurs.
    

      
      

      

    

            “It almost looks like a barrel with tiny little flippers sticking out,” Jacobs told CNN.
    

            Thalassodraco etchesi likely would have glided through the water using its tail for propulsion rather than its fins, added Jacobs, and its deep ribcage correlates with large lungs which would have allowed it to dive deep underwater.
    

            The newly discovered species has even larger eyes than other ichthyosaurs, covering almost a quarter of its whole skull, which would have allowed it to see in low light conditions deep underwater, said Jacobs, who explained that its tiny smooth teeth were probably used to catch soft prey such as squid.
    

            This is the smallest ichthyosaur found so far. The largest known ichthyosaur lived in North America during the Triassic period and had skulls measuring almost five meters in length – 10 times larger than the Thalassodraco etchesi.
    

            The fossil will be displayed at the Etches Collection, a museum in Dorset which also houses Etches’ many other discoveries.
    

            The research was published in the journal PLOS ONE on Wednesday.

Some Labour MPs have said they will not back the bill

            British Prime Minister Theresa May has confirmed that her government’s detailed plan for leaving the European Union will be published on Thursday.
    

            The so called “
” will for the first time formally lay out the government’s plan to withdraw from the bloc, including on the question of the status of EU nationals living in Britain. 
    

            May made the commitment during Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday.
    

            Lawmakers were due to vote later Wednesday on a separate bill to trigger negotiations on the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, following two days of debate.
    

            They are expected to approve the EU (Notification on Withdrawal) Bill, sending it on to the next stage in the parliamentary process.
    

            The real battle is expected next week, according to Britain’s Press Association news agency, when the bill returns to the House of Commons for detailed scrutiny in the committee stage. Opposition parties will then try to push through a series of amendments.
    

            May wants to trigger Article 50 of the EU Treaty – and so start two years of negotiations to leave the 27-nation economic and political grouping – by the end of March.
    

            Her government was forced to bring legislation to Parliament after the 
it could not trigger Article 50 without the permission of lawmakers.
    

            As a second day of debate on the bill got under way Wednesday, former Labour Party leader Ed Miliband said he would support the measure but outlined major concerns over Brexit’s impact on Britain’s future global relationships – particularly with the United States.
    

            “I can go along with the Prime Minister that ‘Brexit means Brexit,’” he said. “But I cannot go along with the idea that Brexit means Trump. And nor do I believe that is inevitable, and nor do I believe that is what the British people want either.”
    

            Despite Brexit, Britain must continue to cooperate with its European allies on key issues such as defense, foreign policy and climate change, he said, and stand with them to defend common values such as human rights and the rule of law.
    

            Former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who was a vocal supporter of Britain remaining in the European Union, said he would nonetheless vote in favor of the bill to respect the democratic will of the people.
    

            He warned that the Brexit negotiations were likely to be “rather bitter,” and that the EU would seek large sums of money from Britain for projects undertaken while it was still a member.
    

            “The negotiation will be a tradeoff, as all divorces are, between access and money,” Osborne said.
    

            Alex Salmond, international affairs spokesman for the Scottish National Party, highlighted Scotland’s desire to remain part of the single market.
    

            He warned that if the government pursues a “hard Tory Brexit, or full English Brexit as we are calling it in Scotland,” and fails to take account of Scottish interests, then May could face the prospect of another Scottish independence referendum.
    

            “If she is determined to throw down that gauntlet, then she can be absolutely sure that Nicola Sturgeon as First Minister (of Scotland) will pick it up,” he said.
    

            Opening the debate on bill Tuesday, David Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, told parliamentarians they could not block the process.
    

      
      

      

    

            The decision to leave the trade bloc is “a point of return already passed,” he said. “At the core of this Bill lies a very simple question – do we trust the people or not?”
    

            May echoed his words during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday.
    

            “This House has a very simple decision to take,” she said. “We gave the right of judgment on this issue to the British people. They made their choice, they want to leave the EU. The question every member must ask themselves as they go through the lobbies tonight is, ‘do they trust the people?’”
    

            Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has ordered Labour MPs not to attempt to delay the process by voting against the government on Article 50. 
    

            However, at least 22 of his MPs are expected to defy him and support “a wrecking amendment” filed by the Scottish National Party. The amendment would block the bill’s progress on the grounds that the Government has failed to provide for consultation with devolved administrations and has not assured MPs of a meaningful vote at the end of the negotiation process, PA reported. It is highly unlikely to pass when the bill is put to a vote Wednesday evening.  
    

      
      

      

    

            “We can at least stand up to be counted,”
Welsh Labour MP Owen Smith told CNN on Tuesday
 
    

            Many Conservative lawmakers are also against Brexit but are unlikely to support the amendment, saving their ammunition for when Brexit negotiations begin, Smith said. 
    

            The House of Lords, the UK’s upper house, will also need to approve the Article 50 legislation before it can become law.
    

            Britain voted in a referendum last June by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the EU.
    

            However, in both the main parliamentary parties – the Conservatives and Labour – opinion is split over the wisdom of Brexit, with only the small Liberal Democrat party and the Scottish National Party united in their stance to stay in.
    

            Not only will the UK need to negotiate the exit from Europe, but also new trade deals with all its trading partners.

            The Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) has become the world’s “most effective” 
 organization over its leadership on the 
case and willingness to lose money to stand by its principles, said Kelley Eckels Currie, former U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women’s Issues.
    

            The whereabouts of 
 a former tennis doubles world number one, became a matter of international concern for nearly three weeks after she posted a message on social media alleging that a former top Chinese government official had sexually assaulted her. She re-appeared over the weekend in Beijing.
    

            The 
 the main organizational body for women’s tennis internationally, has called for a transparent investigation and assurances about Peng’s safety and well-being, and has threatened to pull out of tournaments in 
over the matter.
    

            “If you had told me a week-and-a-half ago that the Women’s Tennis Association was going to be the most effective and bravest human rights organization in the world I would have thought you were bananas but here we are,” Currie told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.
    

            “The WTA is essentially putting more than a billion dollars on the line over the life of a single member of the Women’s Tennis Association.”
    

            In 25 years of working in human rights, she had never seen any group “actually put something on the line like this for human rights,” said Currie, the former U.S. Representative at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, nominated by then-President Donald Trump.
    

            On Sunday, Peng held a video call with International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach, but the WTA has said this did not address or alleviate its concerns about her wellbeing.
    

            The United States, France, Britain and prominent tennis players have all expressed concerns over Peng, a former Olympian.
    

            It comes as Beijing is preparing to host the Winter Olympics next February. Global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Games over China’s human rights record.
    

            “The tennis season goes all year,” said Currie. “As long as players continue to express concern for her and this continues to be an issue with the WTA and they continue to raise her case, it will continue to remain in some kind of spotlight.
    

            “It will be an issue at the Olympics and before that the Australian Open, and then Roland Garros and Wimbledon. Every time tennis does something and has an audience she will be there.”

The use of a 2013 Mercedes car and drivers to test tires may breach FIA rules
Ferrari face no further action over their private tire test for Pirelli using a 2011 car
Mercedes face a fine or ban, including exclusion from the championship

            Just 10 days after the celebrations of 
, Mercedes is facing the possibility of sanctions after being called to the International Tribunal of Formula One’s governing body.
    

            The German team and the sport’s tire supplier Pirelli have been summoned to explain an alleged 
to the FIA’s disciplinary body.
    

            The tribunal has the power to impose fines and bans, including exclusion from the F1 world championship.
    

            The FIA began an investigation after rival teams Red Bull and Ferrari lodged an official protest on the morning of the Monaco race after discovering Mercedes had helped Pirelli carry out a three-day development test in Spain, which was reported by the stewards.
    

            “The conditions of this testing may constitute a breach of the applicable FIA rules,” the governing body said in a statement.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            In-season testing has been banned in F1 since 2009 but Pirelli has an agreement that says it can run 1,000 kilometers of testing with any marque during the season – as long as every team is offered that opportunity.
    

            After gathering evidence from the Italian tire manufacturer, Mercedes and the other 10 teams, the FIA has decided that Mercedes has a case to answer – though a date has not yet been set for the hearing before a 12-man panel.
    

            Mercedes’ rivals objected because it used race drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg to carry out the test in the team’s 2013 car – and it is primarily for these reasons the sport’s governing body is bringing the case before its tribunal.
    

            The rival teams have accused Mercedes of gaining a significant competitive advantage from the test and of conducting it in secret two days after the Spanish Grand Prix, where both Rosberg and Hamilton suffered tire problems despite the German having started in pole position for the second successive race.
    

            

    

            Mercedes has struggled all season with tire degradation despite being quick in qualifying.
    

            Rosberg took the team’s first grand prix win of the season at the Monaco Grand Prix, held on a slower, street circuit that is not as harsh on tires.
    

            Mercedes released a statement in response to the news that read: “We welcome the opportunity to explain the full facts of the Pirelli test  in an open and transparent manner at the International Tribunal.
    

            “Sporting integrity is of primary importance to Mercedes-Benz and we have the utmost confidence in the due process of the FIA.”
    

            Pirelli tried to assuage the situation by issuing a statement, prior to the FIA’s summons to its International Tribunal, explaining the controversial tire test.
    

            “The use of the car utilized by Mercedes, in particular, was the result of direct communication between FIA and the team itself,” the statement read.
    

            “Pirelli did not ask in any way that a 2013 car be used: not of Mercedes nor FIA nor the teams which, during the year, were offered the opportunity of participating in tests for the development of tires for 2014. 
    

            “Pirelli, in development testing with teams carried out in 2013, has not favored any teams and, as always, acted professionally, with transparency and in absolute good faith.”
    

            Pirelli’s contract to supply tires to F1 runs out at the end of the season. The company had been close to securing a new three-year deal, but a new contract could now be in jeopardy.
    

            In light of this, Pirelli stressed that the recent tire testing had focused on developing tires for 2014 when significant rule changes governing engines will be introduced.
    

            

    

            Ferrari was also asked to explain a tire test carried out at the Italian team’s private Fiorano test track in April.
    

            It used a 2011 car during this test and, for this reason, the FIA concluded the team – which used to be managed by FIA president Jean Todt – had no case to answer.
    

            The governing body explained that “a 2011 car is not deemed to contravene the applicable FIA rules.”
    

            The topic of tires has dominated the 2013 F1 season with many teams, including world champions Red Bull, criticizing the current specification of rubber and the number of pit stops seen during the races.
    

            Pirelli is trialling a new “medium” compound tire at this weekend’s Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, which it then plans to introduce as the race tire for the rest of this season.
    

            It is hoped the new tire will be safer and not split into layers, as has been seen on four occasions this season.
    

            While Pirelli hopes to solve one problem on track, it will be left to a tribunal in Paris to rule on the tire controversy that has split the F1 community.

             “I haven’t dropped a shot in 36 holes, so that feels really good,” he said.
    

            “But it  wasn’t quite as good on the greens today…I had some opportunities on a few  holes that I just misread.”
    

            While the world’s top two have dominated, the emergence of Warren has come of something of a surprise, not least to the man himself.

16 were killed at the airport in twin bombings an hour earlier

            An order to close the Brussels metro ahead of the deadly March terror attacks on the network failed to reach relevant authorities, in part because an email from Belgian federal police was sent to the wrong address, a parliamentary commission has heard.
    

            The commission, established to investigate the March 22 bombings and whether they could have been prevented, heard this week that the senior police official in charge of Brussels’ metro networks first learned more than an hour before the deadly bombing at Maelbeek metro station that the explosions at the city’s airport were a terror attack.
    

      
      

      

    

            At 8:03 a.m. local time – five minutes after the twin blasts at Brussels’ Zavantem airport that killed 16 – Jo Decuyper, chief of railway police for the Brussels region, was informed by military sources at the airport that the blasts were suicide bombings, the commission heard.
    

            A third attacker struck the Maelbeek metro station in central Brussels at 9:11 a.m., killing 16 others.
    

            ISIS claimed responsibility for the attacks. 
    

            

    

            The commission heard that a federal alert was issued by Belgium’s Federal Crisis Center at 8:50 a.m., including an order to close the metro and the main railway stations in Brussels – but it never reached the relevant authorities. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Seventeen minutes later, at 9:07 a.m., federal police sent Decuyper an email ordering the closure of the Brussels metro network until noon, the commission heard.
    

            But, Decuyper told the commission, it was sent to his personal email address, and he did not see the message until after the attacks.
    

            Even if he had seen the message, it would have made no difference, as “at least 30 minutes” were needed to evacuate the metro network, he told the commission.
    

            It was only after the explosion at 9:11 a.m. that the station was closed and the network evacuated.

 to relocate 120,000 asylum seekers in Europe.
    

      
      

      

    

            But the plan would seem to fall short of what is needed. More than 488,400 migrants have come to Europe by sea so far this year, double the number that arrived during all of 2014, according to the

.
    

            At least 8,750 new migrants entered Croatia in a single day this week, according to a statement released Wednesday by the country’s Interior Ministry. 
    

            That number, reported to have entered the Balkan country Tuesday, brings the total number of migrants having entered Croatia to 44,000, the ministry said, without specifying the time period involved.
    

            Individual European countries have begun taking their own measures to tackle the migrant influx.
    

            The Slovakian government announced Wednesday it was suing the European Union over 

    

      
      

      

    

            Although it was approved Tuesday by a majority of ministers meeting in Brussels, four countries – Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and the Czech Republic – strongly opposed the decision. 
    

            Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico said that the Council of the European Union had “overpowered the opposing opinion” with a majority vote and that a decision at that level required a unanimous vote. 
    

            “The quota system is irrational, and in our opinion will end up in disgrace,” he said in a statement. He said Slovakia would not accept the decision and was “launching a lawsuit.”
    

            Meantime, the Hungarian parliament passed a law Monday giving the army new powers to tackle the migrant crisis.
    

            “Under the new law, soldiers will have the authority to detain people, search clothing, baggage or cars, perform traffic checks or apply coercion if necessary,” the  Hungarian government’s International Communications Office said. 
    

            Underscoring the lack of cohesion,
saying that it had adopted 40 infringement decisions against some member states for “failing to fully implement legislation making up the Common European Asylum System.” 
    

            “(T)oday’s 40 infringement proceedings are meant to ensure that Member States actually implement and apply what they had previously agreed to do – and agreed to do rapidly and fully.  Our Common European Asylum System can only function if everyone plays by the rules,” commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans said.
    

            The commission said it had also sent a second “Letter of Formal Notice” – the first step of an infringement procedure that can lead to the European Court of Justice – to Greece over “serious deficiencies in the Greek asylum system.”
    

            “The European Commission still has serious concerns about the availability of adequate reception conditions for asylum applicants and the situation of unaccompanied minor asylum applicants,” it said.

2013-01-29 18:06:00+00:00,,"Kimi Raikkonen says he can win the world champions with Lotus
The Finn was crowned drivers' champion with Ferrari in 2007
Raikkonen finished 2012 in third position, behind Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso
His current deal with Lotus expires at the end of the season

            Never let it be said that Formula One driver Kimi Raikkonen is lacking in confidence.
    

            Although he managed to finish third last season, the Finn was still a whopping 74 points behind world champion Sebastian Vettel, but former world champion Raikkonen remains confident that Lotus can challenge the sport’s elite in the coming season.
    

            “It’s clear from working with them that they are racers, and you can see in their history that they’ve won championships,” the 33-year-old driver, who won the drivers’ championship with Ferrari in 2007, told Lotus’ official website as the team became the first to unveil its new 2013 car this week.
    

            The Finn made his return to F1 in 2012 after a two-year absence and propelled his Lotus car towards the front of the grid, grabbing a win at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on his way to finishing third in the drivers’ championship.
    

            

    

            “Nothing I saw last year made me think that another championship was impossible in the future,” added Raikkonen. “Of course, there is some pretty tough competition out there and everyone wants to win. 
    

            “The team have beaten everyone before and there’s nothing to say they can’t do it again.”
    

            Many observers were surprised to see Raikkonen, who spent time racing in NASCAR and the World Rally Championship during his two-year absence, return to F1 and enjoy immediate success despite being a veteran of 19 previous grands prix wins.
    

            

    

            But Raikkonen never lost doubt in his own ability as a driver.
    

            “I knew I could still perform well in Formula 1 given the right opportunity,” the Finn continued. “It was only other people who had doubts.
    

            “There will be a new car which we’ll want to develop and get working at its best. There are always changes in the sport; some small, some big. Generally everything’s pretty similar, and the feeling of racing on track is pretty familiar.”
    

            Raikkonen is entering the final year of his contract with the British-based team, but he is yet to sit down and discuss his future.
    

            “I’m not really thinking beyond this season at the moment, but I’m sure there will be talk before the end of the year,” said Raikkonen, who will turn 34 in October. 
    

            “I enjoyed my comeback to Formula One last year and there’s no reason to say I shouldn’t enjoy the 2013 season too. I know there will be big changes to the cars and regulations for 2014, so who’s to say that won’t be exciting.”
    

            Raikkonen and his teammate Romain Grosjean will both be on the track for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on March 17.

            She emerged from the hospital accompanied by her husband, Prince William, and carrying a bouquet of yellow roses, and was driven away by a waiting car.

            “Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank the staff at the hospital for the care and treatment the Duchess has received.”
    

            On her way out, Catherine acknowledged the crowd of reporters who have been camped outside the hospital since she was admitted Monday with hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition that involves nausea and vomiting more severe than the typical morning sickness many women suffer during early pregnancy.
    

            Her hospitalization prompted the early announcement of her pregnancy.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            

    

            In his first public comments since then, Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, said he was “thrilled” by the news.
    

            “It’s a very nice thought to become a grandfather in my old age, if I can say so,” he told reporters in London. “I’m very glad my daughter-in-law is getting better.  Thank goodness!”
    

            He also made a humorous reference to a story that dominated the UK headlines Wednesday, involving two Australian DJs who made a prank call to the hospital in which they impersonated Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles.
    

            “How do you know I’m not a radio station?” the prince joked.

            2Day FM apologized Wednesday for a prank it said was “done with light-hearted intentions.”
    

            The duchess is not yet 12 weeks pregnant, Clarence House told CNN on Monday, so the palace is not announcing a due date for the child. Confirmation of the pregnancy followed months of speculation among royalty-watchers.
    

            William and Catherine’s child will be next in line to the British throne after William, regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl.
    

            Planned changes to the law of succession that end the tradition of a boy taking precedence over an elder sister are already de facto in effect, the British Cabinet Office said.
    

            William and Catherine were married at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011, in London’s biggest royal wedding in three decades.
    

            Their baby would be the first grandchild of Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales.

            Liverpool Football Club has requested a formal investigation into the ugly scenes that marred the Champions League final in Paris on Saturday. 
    

            The game, 
, was delayed by over 35 minutes after Liverpool fans struggled to enter the stadium despite many arriving hours before kickoff. 
    

            Tear gas was used by French police as supporters were held in tightly packed areas around the Stade de France, causing safety fears to spread among those who were there. 
    

            “We are hugely disappointed at the stadium entry issues and breakdown of the security perimeter that Liverpool fans faced this evening at Stade de France,” Liverpool said in a 
.
    

      
      

      

    

            “This is the greatest match in European football and supporters should not have to experience the scenes we have witnessed tonight.
    

            “We have officially requested a formal investigation into the causes of these unacceptable issues.”
    

            European football’s governing body, UEFA, said the issue was caused by people without valid tickets trying to enter the stadium and that tear gas was used to maintain control. 
    

            “In the lead-up to the game, the turnstiles at the Liverpool end became blocked by thousands fans who had purchased fake tickets which did not work in the turnstiles,” UEFA said in a 
. 
    

            “This created a build-up of fans trying to get in.  As a result, the kick off was delayed by 35 minutes to allow as many fans as possible with genuine tickets to gain access.
    

            “As numbers outside the stadium continued to build up after kick off, the police dispersed them with tear gas and forced them away from the stadium.
    

            “UEFA is sympathetic to those affected by these events and will further review these matters urgently together with the French police and authorities, and with the French Football Federation.”
    

            Photos showed fans crammed into fenced areas after a bottleneck formed around a particularly tight entry point at the Liverpool end. 
    

            Many fans with tickets say they were held back from entering the stadium in dangerously crowded areas and that communication from security was poor. 
    

            “People without tickets forced the barriers and tried to get inside the stadium to watch the match,” a spokesperson for the Paris Police Prefecture told CNN. “These attempts created crowd movements.”
    

            As confusion spread ahead of kickoff, videos emerged on social media of people – with no clear affiliation to a team – scaling fences around the stadium and running into the ground.
    

            The match eventually started but there were many empty seats at the Liverpool end of the stadium.  
    

            Merseyside Police, who attended the game in an observatory and advisory capacity, said “the vast majority of fans behaved in an exemplary manner, arriving at turnstiles early and queuing as directed.”
    

            “Their observations will be passed on to the relevant authorities as part of the debrief for the game,” Assistant Chief Constable Chris Green said in a 
. 
    

            “We know that people would have witnessed a lot of distressing scenes last night and we wish everyone returning home from Paris a safe journey. 
    

            “Our focus today will be supporting Liverpool city council with the policing of the homecoming parade.”
    

            After the match, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says the team was aware of the pre-match incidents and that their families were impacted. 
    

            “I couldn’t speak to my family yet, but I know the families had real struggles to get into the stadium,” he said.
    

            “I heard a few things that were not good, it was obviously pretty tricky out there but I don’t know more about it.”

U.N. agency: Europe faces humanitarian crisis as migrant backlog mounts in Greece
NATO's top general says ISIS is exploiting migrant crisis to enter Europe

            The European Union announced plans Wednesday for 700 million euros ($760 million) in emergency aid to Greece as the economically struggling country copes with an influx of migrants stranded in hopes of gaining entry into Europe.
    

            The EU’s Christos Stylianides revealed the emergency funding proposal, promising to “fast-track” the assistance. But EU member states must still approve the funding.
    

            “These are extraordinary times,” said Stylianides, European commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management. “We all need to step up our efforts with no delay to prevent a further deterioration of the situation.”
    
We proposed: EUR 700 ml for 3 yrs to cover basic necessities-food, shelter, clean water & emergency health care in overwhelmed Member States

            Greece, the main gateway to Europe, had asked the 
 for help to provide for tens of thousands of migrants in its territory. 
    

            A bottleneck of migrants has backed up rapidly in the wake of other European nations tightening border restrictions –  a development that led the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to warn Tuesday of a burgeoning humanitarian disaster.
    

            The aid proposal – intended to meet basic needs such as food, water and shelter over the next three years – came a day after NATO’s top general 
 a Pentagon briefing that ISIS was exploiting the migrant crisis.
    

            Following testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove told reporters Tuesday that mass migration spurred by the ongoing conflict in Syria and the threat of 
 in the Middle East was allowing terrorists free entry into Europe.
    

            He warned that the mass influx of migrants is allowing ISIS to spread “like a cancer, taking advantage of paths of least resistance and threatening European nations, and our own, with terrorist attacks.”
    

            Breedlove, who is head of Supreme Allied Command in Europe, said the migration “masks the movement of criminals, terrorists and foreign fighters” into the continent.
    

            Elsewhere Tuesday, the U.N. refugee agency warned the constant influx of migrants meant 

    

      
      

      

    

            More than 131,000 migrants entered Europe in the first two months of 2016 – a number close to the total for the first half of 2015, according to the U.N. agency’s figures. 
 entered Europe last year. 
    

            The failure to mount a unified response to the situation means Europe now faces a crisis “largely of its own making” as the buildup of migrants stranded in Greece grows rapidly, a statement said.
    

            Some European countries, including those along the main Balkan migration route through the continent, recently agreed to tighten border controls to slow arrivals to a trickle. 
    

            The move has created a backlog of migrants in Greece, which faces its own severe financial hardships, as the flow of people there from Turkey continues unabated.
    

      
      

      

    

            Tensions boiled over Monday at Idomeni, a major transit camp on the Greece-Macedonia border, as migrants were denied permission to cross into Macedonia. Macedonian authorities have been letting a few hundred cross each day, but only Syrians and Iraqis with photo identification.

 with a post.
    

            The U.N. refugee agency said the number of migrants stuck in Greece had soared to 24,000 by Monday night, with about 8,500 of them stuck at Idomeni.
    

            Also Tuesday, German Chancellor 
 said European countries needed to reinstate the Schengen system of border-free travel within Europe to deal with the crisis rather than implement extra border controls. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “The situation is not yet so that we can be content. Every day we see the pictures from Greece – we have to get back to the Schengen system,” Merkel said at a news conference with Croatian Prime Minister Tihomir Oreskovic. 
    

            Some member states have temporarily suspended 1985’s Schengen Agreement, which has guaranteed free movement within Europe. It is 
 later this month. 
    

            “Greece of course has to protect its borders – this is not about only protecting the Greek-Macedonian border from the Macedonian side, so that we don’t get new routes in the migration flow.”
    

            She also urged EU member states to stick to their 
 among themselves over two years. So far, only hundreds have been resettled.
    

            Rights groups have cautioned against scapegoating refugees after violence such as the 
 in November. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “Significant refugee flows to Europe, spurred largely by the 
, coupled with broadening attacks on civilians in the name of the extremist group (ISIS), have led to growing fear-mongering and Islamophobia,” Human Rights Watch said in its 2016 
.
    

            Breedlove told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that alongside the threat posed by extremist organizations in Europe was the potential for unrest from local nationalists opposed to the unprecedented influx of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and unstable parts of Africa. 
    

            Fears are they could become increasingly violent, building on the small number of attacks against migrant and refugee populations.
    

            

    

            In his Pentagon appearance, Breedlove also pointed a finger at a “resurgent, aggressive 
,” which “poses a long-term and existential threat to the U.S. and our European allies.” 
    

            Russia’s involvement in the Syrian civil war, which Breedlove said had bolstered Syrian President 
 and his allies, has changed the dynamic and “complicated the problem … in the air and on the ground.”
    

            

    

            The view is compounded by Pentagon reports that Russia is using the shaky 
.
    

            Relations between Turkey – the only Muslim-majority member of

            There’s an exclusive club reserved for those who have scored 700 career 
 which just three players belong to – Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth. And now, another man is closing in on that iconic group.
    

            Albert Pujols smashed his 695th career home run on Sunday and edged closer to the 700 HR landmark in the
’ 2-0 win against the 
. He is now just one home run shy of tying Alex Rodriguez for the fourth-most of all time.
    

            The 42-year-old reached the mark with a pinch-hit two-run blast in the bottom of the eighth inning to secure the win and also extended his all-time record of homering off 451 pitchers.
    

            “As I was in the cage, [the commentator] said something [on the radio broadcast] like, ‘It’d be amazing if Albert comes up and hits his last home run against the Cubs.’ It happened,” Pujols said after the game. 
    

            “That’s why I was smiling when I hit first base all the way until the home play because that was the last thing playing in my mind. I just couldn’t believe it happened.”
    

            As he plans to retire at the end of the season, it was likely Pujols’ last game against the Cubs – a team he has historically dominated, hitting 59 home runs, 99 extra-base hits and getting 149 RBIs in 199 career games against them. 
    

            The three-time league MVP has been in resurgent form since the All-Star break in August, hitting .373 with 10 homers in 83 at bats. 
    

            “There are times when you take a step back from being locked into the game and you get to be a fan for a minute and experience it the way everybody else does, and that was one of them,” Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said, according to MLB.com. “You take a moment and take it all in because what he’s doing is absolutely incredible.”
    

            The Cardinals too have come out of the All-Star break swinging and are 29-11, with a commanding lead at the top of the NL Central over the second-place Milwaukee Brewers. 
    

            Pujols returned to the Cardinals this season, the franchise where he began his historic career and where he will end it later this year.
    

            “I’m still going to retire, no matter whether I end up hitting 693, 696, 700, whatever,” Pujols told USA Today last month. “I don’t get caught up in numbers. If you were going to tell me 22 years ago that I would be this close, I would have told you that you’re freakin’ crazy. My career has been amazing.
    

            “I’ve had enough. I’m glad I made the announcement this was it when I signed. Really, I wouldn’t change a thing.”

NEW: The cruise line says crew members acted ""bravely and swiftly""
Passengers recall chaos as people scrambled for lifeboats
One passenger says she thought several times she might die
""Nobody followed any procedure,"" said passenger Brandon Warrick

            At first, Vivian Shafer said, she thought it was part of the magic show aboard her Mediterranean cruise.
    

            During the show, aboard the Costa Concordia, staffers had been “playing with the lights” and using smoke, “so we really weren’t that alarmed” as things began happening on the ship, she said Sunday. 
    

            Shafer said she and her traveling companion, Ronda Rosenthal, returned to their cabin after the ship gave a “shudder,” but were reassured by their cabin steward the ship was experiencing a “small technical difficulty.” And as the two got into bed, someone speaking on behalf of the ship’s captain made an announcement saying there was an electrical problem that would be fixed soon.
    

            However, it became clear that something was amiss aboard the 1,500-cabin luxury vessel, after the two heard announcements regarding lifeboats and muster stations. They dressed, grabbed their life jackets and went to investigate, coming upon a chaotic scene.
    

            “We peeked around the corner to kind of see what people were doing … and my gosh, people were actually getting in a lifeboat,” Shafer said. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            At least five people died after the Concordia ran aground on the tiny island of Giglio Friday night. Several others remained unaccounted for. 
    

            Survivors recounted a frantic rush by passengers to get on lifeboats, while the crew appeared helpless and overwhelmed to cope.
    

            “There wasn’t anybody to help you,” Shafer said. “I mean, the passengers were loading the lifeboats by themselves.”
    

            Carnival Corporation, the parent company of Costa Cruises, said in a statement Saturday that it was “working to fully understand the cause of what occurred. The safety of our guests and crew members remains the number-one priority of Carnival Corporation … and all of our cruise lines.”
    

            Costa Cruises on Sunday said crew members on board the Concordia “acted bravely and swiftly to help evacuate more than 4,000 individuals during a very challenging situation. We are very grateful for all they have done.” 
    

            It said preliminary indications are that there may have been “significant human error” on the part of the ship’s captain.
    

            Compounding the evacuation problems was that only one side of lifeboats was available as the ship was listing. Passenger Laurie Willits, from Ontario, Canada, said some lifeboats on the higher side got stuck, leaving people suspended in mid-air amid the sounds of children crying and screaming.
    

            “It was so crowded, and there was no room for us,” said Brandon Warrick, who was sailing with his siblings. They arrived late, he said Sunday, and “it was just bad, like mad scrambles to get into the lifeboats. Nobody followed any procedure. The crew was yelling for people to wait their turn and pretty much it was just a giant every man for himself, to get onto the lifeboat.”
    

            He said his family hung back because “we didn’t want to make it worse.”
    

            His sister, Amanda Warrick, said she thought several times that she might die, as they waited at least an hour and a half for more rescue boats after all the lifeboats departed. 
    

            As the ship took on water and listed to the side, “We were just holding onto the railing, trying not to fall,” Brandon Warrick said.
    

            “I just remember standing on the decks,” Amanda Warrick said. “There were barely any people left.” She said she didn’t see any crew members “until the very last minute” and they were given no information about how long they would have to wait or whether any more help was coming.
    

            Her primary concern, she said, was staying with her brothers. “There was no way that we were going to be separated.”
    

            Costa Cruises said Sunday its crew members hold a certificate in basic safety training and are trained to assist in emergency situations. Every two weeks, the company said, all crew members perform a ship evacuation simulation.
    

            Shafer said the only help they received from the crew was one young woman who approached her and told her to tighten her life vest.
    

            “I was really disappointed and surprised,” she said. “The crew was so young. You would have thought they could have handled it better.” She said she thinks passengers should at least have been told to grab their coats, shoes and warm clothing.
    

            Rosenthal said she believes the two waited at least 40 minutes to get on a lifeboat. The two had just embarked at the Italian port of Civitavecchia, she said, and had not undergone the mandatory safety drill, scheduled for the next evening. However, she had just taken a cruise and so she knew where the life jackets were stored, she said. 
    

            “Lack of communication was a big thing for me,” she said, “and it wasn’t the language barrier … it wasn’t handled at all like the previous cruise I had been on.” Even on shore, she said, people were wandering around aimlessly.
    

            She said once she and Shafer got on board a lifeboat, people were angry with them, as the boat was crowded. She did not clarify whether the crew members or other passengers were angry.
    

            Passenger Benji Smith on Saturday recounted making his own rope ladder to save himself and his wife.
    

            “It was the Marx brothers, watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat,” he said. “I felt like the disaster itself was manageable, but I felt like the crew was going to kill us.”
    

            After helping passengers, some said, crew members jumped overboard and swam ashore.
    

            Smith said even the safety presentation was more of a “sales pitch” for shore excursions.

EPL champions Manchester City drawn in same group as Real Madrid
Borussia Dortmund and Ajax also in tough looking Group D
Title holders Chelsea in same group as Serie A champions Juventus

            Spanish champions Real Madrid were paired with their English counterparts Manchester City as the draw for the European Champions League was made Thursday in Monaco.
    

            The heavyweight pair will also have Borussia Dortmund and four-time winners Ajax Amsterdam for company in Group D, with only the top two going through to the last 16 knockout stages.
    

            Roberto Mancini’s City were knocked out in the group stages of last season’s competition, won by fellow English Premier League side Chelsea, while Real Madrid fell at the semifinal stage to Bayern Munich.
    

    

            The “Group of Death” contains all champions of their respective leagues with Dortmund claiming the Bundesliga title for the second straight year and Ajax winning the Dutch crown.
    

            Chelsea have Serie A winners Juventus for company in Group E, along with Shakhtar Donetsk of the Ukraine and Danish new boys Nordsjaelland.
    

            Chelsea, who beat Bayern on penalties in last season’s final, would be the first team to defend the title in the Champions League era.
    

            Barcelona, beaten so dramatically by Chelsea in last year’s semifinals, have Benfica of Portugal, Russia’s Spartak Moscow and Scottish champions Celtic in Group G.
    

            Three-time champions Manchester United were drawn in Group H with Portugal’s SC Braga, Galatasaray of Turkey and  Romanians CFR-Cluj.
    

            Like their city rivals, United fell at the group stages in last year’s competition after losing at  FC Basel and will be keen to avoid a similar fate.
    

            Bayern, still smarting at their defeat to Chelsea in their own Allianz Arena back in May’s final, have Spain’s Valencia, Lille of France and BATE Borisov of Belarus in Group F.
    

            Seven-time winners AC Milan, who have lost several key players in the transfer window, were joined by Zenit St. Petersburg of Russia, Belgium’s Anderlecht and Malaga of Spain, who are making their debut in the Champions League.
    

            New French champions Montpellier are also appearing for the first time and having sold star striker Olivier Giroud to Arsenal will face the Gunners in Group B.
    

            Bundesliga Schalke and Olympiakos of Greece complete the section.
    

            Big spending Paris St Germain were pitted in Group A with Dinamo Kyiv of the Ukraine, Portuguese giants Porto and Dinamo Zagreb of Croatia.  
    

            All the teams will be bidding to make the final of this year’s competition which takes place on May 25 at Wembley Stadium in London.

            Sofia Shapatava earned $2,900 in the first three months of the year. Now there is no money coming in. She used to travel the world. But now she is stuck in her home city, living with her parents and wondering whether she will ever play tennis professionally again. 
    

            There isn’t much of a vista for Shapatava to enjoy 
from her mum and dad’s four-bedroom house in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. There is no garden or yard to calm the soul, just a parking spot. 
    

            “All you can do is stick your head out of a window,” she told 
 via Skype. 
    

            The longer the 31-year-old is confined, the more her perspective changes. Time passes at snail’s pace for a tennis player who cannot play. Slow-moving days allow for questions to swirl around a restless mind, the anxiety and doubts increasing with intensity each passing day. 
    

            Coronavirus has already significantly affected the world No. 375 and with professional tennis not expected to resume until at least June 7, her financial situation will only worsen. 
    

            A family member has died after being infected by the virus which has 
 Her sister, meanwhile, lives in New York, America’s epicenter for a 
 which has killed thousands and caused the city’s morgues to overflow. 
    

            “My mom’s cousin got infected and he passed away so that was very bad news for us,” she said. “It’s very depressing because I knew him since I was a kid. I know many Italian players who are at home for longer than me and I think it’s getting hard for them too. It’s just sad and it’s very weird, it’s like science fiction book. We are all pretty depressed.” 
    

            It is the severity of her plight, and of other lower-ranked players, that has driven Shapatava to start an 
 asking for financial help from the International Tennis Federation (ITF) for players struggling to pay the bills. At the time of writing, nearly 2,000 people had signed the petition.
    

            “It’s very hard and very scary,” said Shapatava who, like every professional player, does not earn a fixed wage. 
    

            Tennis players are not employees of any organization or governing body. Shapatava gets paid when she plays. Her clothes and racquet strings are sponsored, but there are no monetary rewards. While it is usual for a player to support his or her coaching staff, for Shapatava it’s the opposite. Her German coach helps her financially. 
    

            “I’ve talked to so many players and I’ve a couple of friends who don’t know how to pay the rent this month. A petition is a way to be heard. I don’t demand, I’m just basically trying to get attention so the ITF – and who if not them – can support us. 
    

            “We pay fines for everything, if we do something on court or withdraw from a tournament late, so I think, in a way, we belong to them.”
    

            Shapatava began thinking about a petition when professional tennis was suspended last month, just as she was preparing to walk onto the court during a tournament in Olimpia, Brazil. The sport’s governing bodies did not speak to the players, she says, and did not offer to reimburse those already struggling to meet the astronomical cost of participating in a global sport.
    

            “Many people expensed a lot of money to get there and we didn’t get paid,” she said. “We cannot work. We cannot play club matches, which is the biggest income for lower-income tennis players outside of playing tennis and coaching.”
    

            The ITF, which describes itself as a non-profit organization, directed CNN to an 
which said that as of April 9 it was implementing a series of measures to safeguard jobs, which included a job protection scheme for employees and the “utilization of funds” from ITF reserves. It was also looking into various options to support nations and players, it said, and would “provide more information when we have completed that process.”
    

            The low prize money on offer at smaller events and traveling costs mean players outside the top 100 often live hand to mouth. 
 a player would have to earn around $200,000 a year to make a living wage. Shapatava has earned $354,725 in prize money in her career. 
    

            She mainly competes in the ITF Women’s World Tennis Tour, which offers 500 entry-level and mid-level professional tournaments at five prize money levels: $15,000, $25,000, $60,000, $80,000 and $100,000. This year alone she has played in Las Vegas, California, Kentucky, Michigan and France. The most she has won at an event is $926.
    

            In ordinary times she would supplement her income by playing in club matches in Germany and France. 
    

            “That’s actually the biggest income for players ranked lower than 250,” she explained. “It usually pays more than you get in six months of competing.”
    

            But her fight is not solely for money, it is for the future of her sport. “That’s why I’m trying so hard to be heard,” she said. 
    

            The financial disparities between the sport’s high performers and the rest has always been stark. It has long been argued that not enough money trickles down to those lower in the rankings. Coronavirus has simply accentuated this.  
    

            Last year, Roger Federer said he would work to ensure lower-ranked players and qualifying-grade players would get a larger share of any prize money increases the ATP Player Council negotiates in the coming years.
    

            Patrick Mouratoglou, Serena Williams’ coach, posted on 
 on Wednesday saying that this “challenging period” was “emphasizing how dysfunctional” the sport is. 
    

            A number of organizations, each having differing responsibilities, revenues and stakeholders, are responsible for the running of tennis. On the women’s side alone there is the ITF Women’s World Tennis Tour and the WTA Tour, which consists of 53 tournaments and four grand slams and is where the most elite players compete.
    

            In a statement to CNN, Steve Simon, chairman and chief executive officer of the WTA, said: “We wish there was a way everyone, especially those in need the most, could be compensated at the level they were expecting but the needs are so great and the WTA unfortunately is not in a financial position to do that.” 
    

            He added that extending the current 44-week season so that more tournaments could take place this year was under consideration. 
    

            

    

            That it is also a sport of individuals competing against each other for supremacy perhaps also explains why Shapatava feels tennis lacks community spirit. 
    

            “It’s a problem that existed, exists and probably will [continue to] exist,” she said. “I’m really scared about what the next two to three months will bring.
    

            “The difference between the lower ranked and the higher ranked is huge. It’s something that’s in the system and you know what you get yourself into but right now the situation is not about the sport, it’s about life.
    

            “Top 50 players in both the men’s and women’s rankings are 100 people … but there are 3,000 players, men and women combined, in the ranking.
    

            “If 50% of tennis players quit [because] of this I don’t think tennis will survive. I understand many tickets are sold on big tournaments, but there are also smaller tournaments which also sell a lot of data; we have live streams, live scores, there are also umpires and linesmen and women making their way up and people organizing the tournaments. That is also raising money for the federations and organizations. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “While these top players are great for the promotion of the sport, there are still 96.5% of players that also build it up. It’s also very important. It’s something that has to exist to support the sport.”
    

            Shapatava, a classically trained pianist, has continued to play on the tour for over 15 years for little financial reward because, simply, she loves the sport.
    

            She could have been a surgeon but left medical colleague to pursue her sporting dream. Tennis forces her to better herself each year, she said, and tests her physically and mentally. But when the tour resumes, will she be competing? 
    

            “My parents are not the youngest, I have bills to pay, people to support, my coach is not a billionaire, he cannot support me forever, my ranking is pretty low already to make an income in tennis and if I don’t play at all or don’t coach at all I’m not going to be able to go in July and travel to tournament and spend money on that,” she said.
    

      
      

      

    

            “I have to first of all find a way to gain money and then if I find a way to do that maybe I’ll play again maybe later in the fall. No one can fly straight out to a tournament. They have to first work their way into a financial situation where they can afford that.”
    

            And then there is the mental toll to consider. 
    

            “The other question is, if someone would be willing to continue to do that because after this break you start to evaluate things differently mentally and maybe you’re not ready to compete in tournaments where you know you’re not going to gain money,” she said. “I’m not sure many will be mentally ready for that. I’m not sure I will be able to play, nor financially, nor mentally, because it takes a lot [out of you].”
    

            “It would be pretty hard to come back to playing. I don’t think many have it in them to come back and play like they used to, especially those who were already struggling with injury, those who already struggled financially.”
    

            Through the uncertainty, Shapatava will strive to be heard. It is not only her future that depends on it.

            World No. 61 Jessica Pegula stunned No. 5 seed Elina Svitolina at the 
 to advance to the quarterfinals on Monday.
    

            The 26-year-old American, who is the daughter of the NFL team Buffalo Bills owners Kim and Terry Pegula, won 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 on Rod Laver Arena to reach the last eight of a 
 for the first time.
    

            Pegula was the aggressor from the outset, with Svitolina unusually passive, allowing the American to dictate the early proceedings, clinching the first set.
    

            

    

            Ukrainian Svitolina rallied in the second set and helped by a patchy spell from Pegula leveled the match. But Pegula recovered her poise and ran away in the final set to reach the last eight of a grand slam for the first time in her career.
    

            “I’m hitting the ball really well, I thought I served really well, which is really important, especially against the top players. Any extra free points you can get is huge,” Pegula 
 afterwards.
    

            “I’m just happy that I’m competing well, hitting well, moving well. I feel good, everything feels pretty solid, so I’m just going to take that to the next match.”
    

            Pegula’s parents are also the owners of the NHL’s Buffalo Sabres and after her victory, she 
 one of the TV cameras – as is tradition –“Hi Mom. Hi Dad. See u next rnd.”
    

            Her victory also 
 the Bills’ Twitter account, with it writing: “LET’S GOOOOO.”
    

            In beating Svitolina, the 26-year-old recorded her first career top-10 victory. At this year’s grand slam, Pegula has already beaten two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka, US Open champion Sam Stosur and Kristina Mladenovic without dropping a set.
    

            For the 26-year-old Svitolina, it was her sixth grand slam loss to a player ranked outside the top 30 since she became a top-10 mainstay herself in May 2017 as she searches for her maiden grand slam title.
    

            “It was not a good day for me today,” Svitolina 
 the media afterwards. “I was making way too many errors. It is tough to pick why it was like this but a mixture of things.
    

            “It’s disappointing because I’ve been playing very good but I feel like it was one of those days where nothing was going my way.”
    

            

    

            Pegula’s victory sets up a meeting with her compatriot and No. 22 Jennifer Brady, who overcame No. 28 seed Donna Vekic 6-1, 7-5 on Monday.
    

            Brady had her own message for Pegula after the game, 
 “Bring it Jess” before departing Rod Laver Arena.

Seattle Seahawks rookie is Pro Kick grad 

            (Laughs) “I don’t know if Shad would be too happy if I tried to go back to soccer – but if they need me I’m available.”
    

            “It makes me want to vomit,” he bluntly says of a moment that marked his short NFL preseason stint in 2004. “To think I was just kicking a ball without any technical knowledge at all.”
    

            Things have come a long way since then.
    

            Largely thanks to Chapman’s Pro Kick Australia school, founded on the lessons he learned as an NFL hopeful, the country is cranking out punters to major US college programs and infiltrating the pros. 
    

            No fewer than 65 Pro Kick graduates will suit up for Division I schools this year, according to Chapman, and three are likely to stick on NFL rosters. 
    

            They include Seattle Seahawks rookie Michael Dickson, who skipped his senior season at Texas after winning the Ray Guy Award, given to college football’s top punter. 
    

            Like most other Pro Kick students – and like Chapman himself – Dickson played Australian rules football and had little understanding of the sport the Aussies call “gridiron.”
    
This. Kid. Has. A. LEG. 
EVERY punt by 
 rookie punter Michael Dickson (
) 
 

            No matter. After a brief tryout  – which he attended on a whim with friend Oscar Bradburn, now with Virginia Tech – Dickson enrolled in Pro Kick in March 2015.
    

            By September, he was booming punt after punt for the Texas Longhorns in front of more than 80,000 at Notre Dame.
    

            “I never really watched a full game of American football until I played my first game against Notre Dame,” Dickson recently 
 “It took me two years to really fully understand (the rules).”
    

            Dickson’s talents shone in a win at the Texas Bowl in December, when he landed 10 punts inside Missouri’s 20-yard line and walked away as the game’s MVP. 
    

            Texas coach Tom Herman said he had never seen a punter affect a game that way.
    

            “That’s what we try to do,” says Chapman. “We feel like our duty is to bring attention back to the punting game so that coaches realize, hey, if we’ve got a good one, we can attack more,” 
    

            Dickson will likely be joined in the NFL this season by fellow Pro Kick alumnus Jordan Berry of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cameron Johnson of the Philadelphia Eagles. 
    

            Another Aussie rules convert Lachlan Edwards punts for the New York Jets, while compatriot Brad Wing is looking for a call up after three seasons with the New York Giants. 
    

            “Three to five Australians out of 32 (NFL teams) is not a bad ratio,” says Chapman.
    

            Waiting in the wings are about a dozen Pro Kick punters in the Pac-12 Conference – where the speedy game suits Australian punters who are mobile, says Chapman – and others in the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and Big Ten Conference
    

            As a result, American football is rapidly catching up with basketball as a sport where Australians are thriving in the US. Last year, 
, while another 
– including Rookie of the Year Ben Simmons.
    

            In Australian rules football players score by kicking a oval ball between goalposts, often at long distances while on the run. The sport’s unique skill set makes it a breeding ground for Pro Kick. 
    

            “When it comes to punting, we have a million punters,” says Chapman, who earned his own shot with the Green Bay Packers after his eight-year career in Aussie rules ended. 
    

            Chapman was cut the week before the 2004 regular season, largely due to inexperience. “If I had known what the coaches actually wanted, I could have tied my kicking pursuit with (that) rather than just kicking blindly and wildly,” he says.
    

            He also didn’t understand the business side of things. 
    

            The Packers used a third-round pick on Ohio State punter B. J. Sander, making it unlikely an unproven lad from Down Under would crack the roster, he says.  
    

            Greater awareness “would have allowed me to think I may have to look elsewhere,” he says. “I want people not to make those mistakes.”
    

            His experience spawned Pro Kick. 
    

            He remembers thinking, “With a little bit of guidance to do this right, there are many guys in Australia who can kick a football and succeed at this.” He also thought, “If you go about it the wrong way 20 more will fail.”
    

            Chapman opened his school in Melbourne in 2007, but soon realized his pupils would be better served approaching US colleges rather than gunning straight for the NFL. 
    

            The fees are not cheap, starting at nearly $11,000 for a one-year course, which encompasses three days a week of punting practice and two days in the weight room, along with academic preparation to meet NCAA eligibility rules.
    

            But Chapman stresses that Pro Kick is open only by invitation to those who he thinks have the ability to make it as punters. The fees, he says, are more an investment in their future, virtually guaranteeing a full ride at a US university.
    

            “Ninety-five percent of the people in our program have walked away with $180,000,” Chapman says, estimating the value of a four-year scholarship. 
    

            What helps Pro Kick’s success rate is Chapman’s close relationship with a number of US college coaches, who he declined to name because of the sensitivity of their arrangement.
    

            Many, he says, will take a player on his word – often without even seeing them kick in person.
    

            “It’s like ordering a pizza,” Chapman says. “You tell us what you want and we will go get it. 
    

            “You want this type of leg, this type of strength, this type of kick? We’ve got the player you want … let’s go and train him for the next six to eight months, and then we’ll deliver him on your doorstep.
    

            “That’s pretty much how it works.”
    

            Pro Kick’s strength lies in punting, but teaches other positions, namely placekicking, to about 10% of students, and punt returning.
    

            Former Hawaii standout Scott Harding, 
, also learned to catch at Pro Kick. 
    

            Remarkably, he was Hawaii’s starting punter, punt returner, and second leading receiver in 2013.
    

            Aside from teaching the rules of the game, the most important lessons learned at Pro Kick are the cultural nuances that young Australians will face in America. 
    

            “Most have never been to the US when they get there,” Chapman explains. “We teach them what it’s like at college.
    

            “What the other schools are, what the rules are, having girlfriends there, the police systems, the cultural things in the North and the South, saying ‘Yes ma’am’ … 
    

            “So that all they want to do when they get there is just kick the damn ball.”

            Aged 16 years, four months and 20 days old, Gukesh broke the previous record held by his compatriot 
 who defeated the world champion in February when he was 16 years six months and 10 days old.
    

            “Obviously, beating 
 is always special but I was not really very proud of that game,” Gukesh said in a press release after beating Carlsen at the Aimchess Rapid on Sunday,
    

      
      

      

    

            Carlsen had seemed in control, two pawns up after the opening, until he made a key mistake on his 25th move that endangered his queen. 
    

            “I was really disappointed because I’d seen an easy way to win, but I thought I’d seen something even easier, but I hadn’t seen his threat of trapping the queen in the middle of the board,” Carlsen said, according to Chess24.com.
    

            As he realized the double threat to his king and queen, Carlsen spent almost seven minutes pondering his options on his next move, visibly frustrated with himself.
    

            He continued to play, spinning on his chair and shaking his head, but could not undo the damage and resigned shortly afterwards.
    

            It was Carlsen’s second defeat in two days to one of India’s teenage grandmasters at the Aimchess Rapid, after he lost to 19-year-old Arjun Erigaisi.
    

            On the tournament’s first day, the Norwegian star almost suffered another defeat to another 16-year-old from India – Aditya Mittal – but survived the two most dangerous moments to scrape a draw.
    

            “Pragg is the only one I’ve lost multiple times to. As for Arjun and Gukesh: Arjun I’ve generally beaten; Gukesh very similar,” Carlsen said afterwards in a press release.
    

            “I think Gukesh has been extremely impressive in classical chess recently. Perhaps this rapid win wasn’t his proudest effort, even though getting a win is always nice.”
    

            Carlsen, who began the tournament chasing his fifth win on the Meltwater Champions Chess Tour this year, also suffered a shock defeat to 18-year-old Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan.

World number three won the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals Sunday
Federer's win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was his 70th career title and his 100th final
He says he'll return from the off season determined to win gold at Wimbledon in 2012

            Roger Federer wants to add an Olympic singles gold medal to his list of achievements in tennis after securing his 70th career title at the ATP World Tour Finals in London.
    

            The world number three defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga Sunday in what was a record sixth victory at the season-ending event.
    

            Federer’s triumph secured his 70th career title in his 100th final, a landmark to make up for the fact that he failed to win a grand slam in a season for the first time since 2002.
    

            But the 30-year-old has vowed to come back stronger next year as he bids for a gold medal in the men’s singles at the London 2012 Olympics, to go with the one he won in the doubles at Beijing in 2008.
    

            If any extra incentive were needed, it will be held at Wimbledon – which Federer calls ‘my club’ – a place where he has won six times.
    

            

    

      
      

      

    

            He told CNN World Sport: “That’s why I took some time off before Fall in the hope that I’m going to be more energized and more fresh when the Olympics come around next year.
    

            “We’re going to be as well prepared as we can be because we’ve had some tough Olympic Games on the other side of the planet whereas this time around we’ll be playing at Wimbledon.
    

            “It’s a very special occasion for the top players, and for all of us to experience that in our lifetime is going to be fantastic. I’m looking forward to it, playing at ‘my’ club, hopefully winning Olympic gold. We’ll see what happens but I’m excited already.”
    

            Federer  was eclipsed for most of the year by Serbian Novak Djokovic, who went on a incredible 43-match unbeaten run, and secured the Australian Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open crowns.
    

            

    

            The Swiss did make the final at the French Open, only to be beaten in four sets by Rafael Nadal, and also suffered a heartbreaking defeat in the semifinals at Flushing Meadows in New York, squandering two match points against Djokovic before losing in five sets.
    

            But he put together a strong finish to the 2011 campaign, winning titles in Paris and Basel, before his triumph in London.
    

            “This is what champions are made of,” he told CNN World Sport anchor Alex Thomas. “After a big loss, if you are able to come back and prove to yourself that losses do happen.
    

            “Novak has had an amazing year and Rafa, we know how strong he was again on clay, so maybe for me there was not so much to win in a period when it was tough for me.
    

            “That I have been able to save the best until last is amazing and to write history here in London, winning my sixth Tour Finals already, is a record which I’m very proud of.”
    

            Federer said his strong end of season form was a warning to his fellow players that he could begin the 2012 season with a bang.
    

            “Of course I’m exhausted and I want to go on vacation but I am looking forward to next year because usually when I finish strongly I also start strongly again the following season.
    

            “We’re looking forward to a great season next year on the Tour – its not going to get any easier, I know that, but it’s nice to get these wins and all I want to do now is celebrate.”

Parliament is expected to confirm his government on Monday
The announcement is expected to end the uncertainty that has gripped Italy for months

            Italian center-left politician Enrico Letta has fully accepted a mandate to form a government, he told reporters Saturday.
    

            Letta made the announcement after meeting with President Giorgio Napolitano, who had given him that mandate on Wednesday.
    

            The 46-year-old former deputy prime minister and his ministers will be sworn in on Sunday at 11:30 a.m., the presidential palace said.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Parliament is expected to confirm his government through a vote of confidence on Monday.
    

            Letta’s acceptance of the leadership role is expected to limit the uncertainty that has gripped the nation since February, when elections left none of the candidates with enough support to form a government.
    

            He gave reporters a list of his 18 ministers, two of whom are members of the center-right People of Freedom Party led by three-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
    

            Three of the ministers are holdovers from the government of Mario Monti, the outgoing prime minister.
    

            Nearly all the others are members of Letta’s Democratic Party or people close to it.
    

            Letta had accepted Napolitano’s request to take the job with reservations 
    

            Napolitano, 87, was re-elected by Italy’s Parliament on Saturday to an unprecedented second term as president.
    

            February’s general election resulted in a three-way split among the right, the left and a wild-card party.
    

            Letta said this week that the most important step would be to tackle the country’s 11.6% unemployment rate, which has pushed many young Italians to leave the country.
    

            The second most pressing issue facing Italy is the need for political reform, he said.
    

            Constitutional changes are needed to reduce the number of members of parliament and fix an electoral system that has kept the country locked in a political stalemate it can’t afford, he said.
    

            “We need to do this together with the largest participation possible,” he said.
    

            He also said the European Union’s policy of austerity needs to change.

The Chilean says he is moving on for ""sporting reasons""
Pellegrini has been tipped to succeed Roberto Mancini at Manchester City
UEFA says it will not impose second-year ban on Malaga after club meets financial rules

            Malaga coach Manuel Pellegrini has added his name to May’s managerial merry-go-round by announcing he is leaving the Spanish club at the end of this season.
    

            The Chilean has been linked to the top job at Manchester City after the English Premier League club 
 earlier this month.
    

            Pellegrini had a one-season spell in charge of Real Madrid before joining Malaga in 2010, shortly after  Qatar’s Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Al-Thani bought the club.
    

            This season the 59-year-old guided “Los Boquerones” to the heady heights of the Champions League quarterfinals, losing to one of this weekend’s finalists, Borussia Dortmund.
    

            But Pellegrini said he was now standing down for “sporting reasons” – not because of the club’s financial problems. Malaga confirmed to CNN that the head coach would be leaving at the end of the season.
    

            The Spanish club agreed Pellegrini could leave despite having two years left on his contract. 
    

            “My coaching staff and I are separating from Malaga but our union with this city will be eternal,” Pellegrini said in a social address to the Malaga Provisional Council.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “We leave the club qualified for Europe with the mission accomplished. We had a time with the club that was very rewarding.”
    

            Pellegrini plans to stay at the helm for Malaga’s final two matches. The club, sixth in the La Liga standings, plays Deportivo La Coruna at home before closing the season against Barcelona at the Nou Camp on June 1.
    

            “Sunday will be my last match at La Rosaleda and will be very exciting for me,” Pellegrini said.
    

            “I’m not leaving due to the matter of money but looking for a project that allows me to develop my profession conveniently.”
    

            Pellegrini continued in a statement on the club’s website: “Everyone has the right and obligation to follow their chosen path, and Malaga must do the same.  The club requires a realistic project next season.  
    

            “Malaga had a past without Manuel Pellegrini, and will also have a future without Manuel Pellegrini
    

            “I will be eternally grateful to the owners of the club, who always had blind faith in me. The most important foundation of this club is the strength and support from the fans.”
    

            

    

            It’s not only on the Costa del Sol that waves are being felt in the managerial market.
    

            Along with Mancini’s departure, Everton manager David Moyes will replace Alex Ferguson at EPL rival Manchester United.
    

            Carlo Ancelotti has indicated he wants to leave French champion Paris Saint-Germain, possibly to replace outgoing Real Madrid boss Jose Mourinho, who in turn has been linked with a return to Chelsea in place of Rafa Benitez.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Tony Pulis has also left EPL side Stoke City while Roberto Martinez is said to be considering his position at Wigan following relegation from England’s top flight.
    

            

    

            As Pellegrini pondered his future, UEFA ruled on Malaga’s eligibility to compete in European competitions on Wednesday.
    

            Malaga fell foul of the European governing body’s Financial Fair Play rules in 2012 and was subsequently 
 from its tournaments.
    

            Malaga owed player wages and has debts with other football sides as well as the Spanish tax authorities, claimed UEFA.
    

            But UEFA’s Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) confirmed that Malaga has now fulfilled conditions imposed upon it and a second year of “suspended sanctions that had been imposed will not apply.”
    

            Malaga was allowed to continue in this season’s Champions League but is not eligible to compete in next season’s Europa League even if the team qualifies for one of the three places on offer to Spanish sides.
    

            The club is awaiting a decision, due next month, on its appeal against this ban to the global Court of Arbitration for Sport.
    

            Malaga was reported to have splashed out $80 million in 2012 assembling a squad containing big names like Spain’s double European champion Santiago Cazorla and Dutch defender Joris Mathijsen, but the many top players left as the club cut its costs.

2018-03-17 01:24:00+00:00,,"Greenland's capital Nuuk is getting a stylish new prison
Humane prisons are controversial, with some questioning whether criminals should live in beautiful buildings
Greenland's serious offenders, currently exiled in Denmark, are returning home

            Nestled into the stunning Arctic landscape with panoramic views of sparkling fjords and snowy mountains, Ny Anstalt could easily be mistaken for a luxury ski lodge. But this stylish complex in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, is actually a prison.
    

            As any onlooker can deduce, when it opens in 2019 it will not be a normal penitentiary. It will be a “humane prison” – a correctional facility that emphasizes rehabilitating criminals through positive design, rather than punishment.  
    

            Exponents of the “humane prison” philosophy believe that if prisons mimic the conditions of normal life, as far as is possible, offenders have a greater chance of successful reintegration into society, and less chance of re-offending. 
    

            Ny Anstalt, however, is more than an architectural accomplishment for the country. It hopes to end a human rights issue that has haunted the island nation for decades. 
    

            Nuuk is located near the southern tip of Greenland, a former Danish colony that straddles the Arctic circle. With only 56,000 residents, it is the least-densely populated country in the world. 
    

            Across this unfenced wilderness there are just 
 with a collective capacity for 154 prisoners. Greenland runs a uniquely “open” prison system, with many inmates allowed to leave the premises to work, study, or even go hunting, before returning at night. As a consequence, none of the existing penitentiaries can accommodate high-security inmates, and this has long presented Greenland with a problem.
    

            Many Nordic countries have famously low crime rates: in Iceland, for example, there were only 
 in 2015, according to 
 statistics. But in Greenland, the proportion of citizens sent to prison is about three times higher than in the rest of the Nordic region, according to the Danish Prison and Probation Service. 
    

            Greenland’s crime problem can be traced back to reforms instigated after the second world war. About 
 of the country’s population are indigenous Inuit people – the remaining 12% are mostly of Danish descent.  
    

            In the 1950s, the Danish government introduced sweeping changes, aimed at moving people into urban centers, giving them access to welfare services and reducing reliance on dwindling seal populations. But the dismantling of a traditional hunting and fishing society provoked social problems. “Greenlandic people suffer from similar difficulties to other indigenous groups who have experienced colonization,” says Naaja Nathanielsen, director of the Greenland Prison and Probation Service. “Alcohol is often involved in crime and contributes to the relatively high crime rate.”   
    

            Without a suitable facility, since the 1960s, Greenland has sent its most dangerous – and mentally ill – inmates to Herstedvester, outside the Danish capital Copenhagen, says Erik Bang, head of the construction unit at the Danish Prison and Probation Service.  This has created issues as many speak Greenlandic (an Inuit language) rather than Danish so can’t communicate with the guards, and it’s impossible for most to receive visits from their families.  
    

            When Ny Anstalt opens, Nuuk’s current prison, which was built in the 1960s, will close and its inmates will be transferred to the new facility. “The practice of sending Greenlandic prisoners to Denmark will end,” says Nathanielsen, adding that the 30 or so prisoners currently incarcerated in exile will be offered the chance to return to their home country. She says the new prison is long overdue. “Exiling people to serve their sentence in another country, with another language and culture, is very harsh.”
    

            In 2013, Denmark’s Prison and Probation Service, which administers the prison system in Greenland, launched a competition to design Nuuk’s new jail. A team that includes two Danish architecture firms – Friis & Moltke and Schmidt Hammer Lassen – beat five rivals to win the contract. 
    

            The architects say they embraced Ny Anstalt as an opportunity to help address Greenland’s deep-rooted social problems. “Learning about the prisoners and thinking about what conditions brought them to this situation has affected me deeply,” says project manager Jette Birkeskov Mogensen. “Providing them with a good environment for their imprisonment is a big responsibility.” 
    

            Thomas Ruus Christensen, Ny Anstalt’s lead design architect, says that the prison – which has won a World Architecture News Award – is “designed to operate like a small village with residential blocks, workplaces, education and sports facilities, a library, a health center and a church.” 
    

            The 86,000 square foot (8,000 square meter) facility will have 76 cells, 40 of which will be “closed” for maximum security prisoners, while 36 will be “open” for those allowed greater degrees of freedom. Prisoners who have earned the privilege will be allowed to travel into Nuuk to work and earn a wage, before returning to the prison at night.
    

            The private cells are only 130 square feet (12 square meters) but are positioned to look across to Sermitsiaq, a towering mountain on an offshore island, and their windows don’t have bars. Christensen says this wild outlook was a design priority. “You can’t escape the prison because it’s surrounded by a big wall, but you can look at the view and escape in your mind – and that’s important,” says Christensen. 
    

            Although the prison is a modern building, Ny Anstalt will be decorated with traditional Greenland flourishes. “There’s a very distinctive artistic language in Greenland,” says Christensen. “We’re bringing in local artists to decorate communal areas with landscape paintings and traditional designs, and carve etchings of animals into the perimeter wall.”
    

            Design has even been used to manage security at the facility. “The prison is designed over three levels which allows the guards to manage the flow of people between different areas, and control which prisoners encounter each other,” explains Mogenson. This reduces the possibility of violence. 
    

            “The guards don’t need to carry weapons, and can develop better relationships with the prisoners, which is essential to the concept of rehabilitation,” she adds.
    

            Scandinavian countries have pioneered humane prison design because “their societies are characterized by a strong welfare state and relatively high levels of trust,” according to Yvonne Jewkes, a professor of criminology at the UK’s University of Kent.
    

            “There’s also an ancient idea (in Scandanavia) that beauty has a civilizing influence,” says Jewkes. “Whether it’s a coffee cup or a prison, Danish design is always stylish. In prison design, this means light, airy, non-institutional spaces.”
    

            In 2010, a new gold standard for this type of prison was set by a Halden, a 227-inmate, high security, Norwegian penitentiary, often cited as the “model” humane prison. Its facilities include a gym, a rock-climbing wall, jogging trails, a soccer field, a library, a music studio, a dental clinic, and a Family House where prisoners can stay overnight with their partners and children. In 2010, it won the Arnstein Arneberg Award for interior design, although it has also been criticized for being too liberal. 
    

            A humanely designed prison, says Jewkes, can help to foster a sense of purpose, citizenship and hope for the future, which is important because “at some point, the vast majority of prisoners are going to be released.”
    

            The statistics seem to back her up. “A number of studies indicate that reoffending rates are relatively low in Scandinavian countries – often less than 30%,” says Jewkes. 
    

            Rates appear to be much higher in the US and UK. 
, which tracked prisoners from 30 states after their release from prison in 2005, found that within five years over three quarters (76.6%) had been rearrested. In the UK, 
 revealed that 44% of adults are reconvicted within a year of their release.
    

            Jewkes cautions that it is notoriously difficult to make direct comparisons. “Each country’s legal system is different, methods of counting and evaluation vary … and there have not been many long-term studies.” But she also notes that “it’s a matter of common sense that the values embedded in a custodial environment will be embodied by ex-offenders when they are released and re-enter society.”
    

            In the UK, “prisons are like human warehouses, designed to be tools of retribution,” says Jewkes. “Ugly, depressing environments like these breed anger and resentment, and can promote drug use, mental illness, self-harm and suicide.” 
    

            Alan Pritchard, a British former prison governor who now works as a private consultant on criminal justice matters, says that humane prison design works in Scandinavia because “attitudes to incarceration are much more liberal.” 
    

            “I don’t think beautiful, architect-designed prisons would be palatable to either the government or the public in the UK,” he adds.
    

            The other thing that sets apart Scandinavian prison design is size.
    

            Prisons that look like boutique hotels typically house no more than 250 inmates. In Scandinavia, where small population sizes combine with low rates of incarceration, there are not that many people to detain – 
; 
. Both countries have populations of just over 5 million. In England and Wales (Scotland operates as a separate jurisdiction), where the population is 10 times larger, around 85,000 people are kept behind bars.
    

             Two new British prisons – HMP Oakwood and HMP Berwyn – can house 2,106 prisoners each, and there are plans for more “supersize” jails that hold over 1,000 prisoners. Pritchard says that although both the new prisons have education and employment training facilities, their design incorporates heavy security. “With all the gates, barriers, and fences, these prisons don’t effectively support a rehabilitative culture,” says Pritchard.
    

            Humane prisons are seen as prohibitively expensive. Running Norways’s Halden prison costs $150,000 per prisoner per year, according to the Norwegian Correctional Service. Pritchard says the current average annual cost per prisoner in England and Wales is $50,000, while HMP Berwyn – which benefits from economies of scale – will operate at around $20,000. “Accommodating 85,000 inmates in multiple small units is not economically viable,” he says.
    

            Ny Anstalt’s running costs have not yet been finalized. “No doubt it will increase the current budget, but in terms of the human factor it is very much worth the expense,” says Nathanielsen.  
    

            For those with shorter term sentences, she believes Ny Anstalt offers a greater chance of successful rehabilitation. “We live in small communities in Greenland, and eventually the inmates have to return to those communities. For that to be successful, and to prevent future crime, we strive to promote change in each individual. In that regard, humane design absolutely makes sense.”

            Australian rugby league player James Ackerman has died in hospital following a serious injury sustained playing a match on Saturday.
    

            Ackerman, 25, suffered a head injury five minutes into a Queensland Cup match between his team Sunshine Coast Falcons and North Devils.
    

            Queensland Rugby League (QRL) announced his death on Monday.
    

            The father of two young children was treated on the field for more than half an hour by an on-duty doctor before the game was called off and he was rushed to the Royal Brisbane and Women’s hospital.
    
RIP James Ackerman. Thoughts and prayers with the Ackerman Family and

2012-04-10 23:04:00+00:00,,"NEW: The U.S. Justice Department welcomes the court ruling, a spokesman says
NEW: The judgment will not become final for another three months
The court says five suspects can be extradited to the U.S., delays a decision on the sixth
""British justice appears to have been subcontracted to the U.S.,"" one suspect's family says

            The European Court of Human Rights ruled against five terror suspects Tuesday, saying that they can be extradited to the United States despite their claims that they will be poorly treated.
    

            The court ruled that the suspects would not get “ill treatment” in supermaximum security prisons if they are extradited to the United States and convicted in American courts, according to a statement from the European court.
    

            The court still needs to make a decision on one other suspect connected to the case.
    

            The ruling adds another chapter to the long-running legal battle that started when the six suspects were indicted by the United States between 1999 and 2006. The suspects were all arrested in the United Kingdom and have been fighting extradition to the United States for years.
    

            Several of the suspects were alleged to have links to Osama bin Laden, the European Court of Human Rights said.
    

            One of the suspects, Mustafa Kamal Mustafa, who also is known as Abu Hamza, is wanted by the United States on 11 charges, including conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping in Yemen and conspiring with others to establish an Islamic jihad training camp in rural Oregon in 1999.
    

            Another of the suspects, Babar Ahmad, is accused of providing material support to terrorists, conspiracy and money laundering. If convicted, he could face a life prison sentence.
    

            The indictment against Ahmad accuses him of conspiring to provide support to terrorists, including helping to ship gas masks to the Taliban and using U.S.-based websites to raise money for Chechen leader Shamil Basayev. Basayev claimed responsibility for the 2004 Beslan school massacre in Russia. He was killed two years later by Russian agents.
    

            U.S. Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd welcomed the court ruling.
    

            “We look forward to the court’s decision becoming final and to the extradition of these defendants to stand trial in the United States,” he said.
    

            The ruling will not be final for another three months, according to court documents. Any party can refer the case to the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights within that period and request a further examination by a five-judge panel. If the request is refused, the judgment then becomes final.
    

            British Home Secretary Theresa May also applauded Tuesday’s ruling.
    

            “I welcome the decision of the European Court of Human Rights to allow the extradition of Abu Hamza and other terror suspects,” May said. 
    

            “In five of the six cases, the Court found that extradition would not breach their human rights and in the remaining case, it asked for further information before taking a final decision.  We will work to ensure that the suspects are handed over to the U.S. authorities as quickly as possible.”
    

            The court delayed its decision on the sixth suspect, Haroon Rashid Aswat, while further information is provided regarding mental health issues.
    

            Ahmad’s family said it was disappointed in the decision and called for him to face trial in the United Kingdom.
    

            “Babar has already been imprisoned without a trial for almost eight years, something he described in his recent interview to BBC as ‘the most unimaginable type of psychological torture,’” a family statement said.
    

            “Babar is a British citizen accused of a crime said to have been committed in the U.K. and all the evidence against him was gathered in this country. Nevertheless, British justice appears to have been subcontracted to the U.S.”
    

            The other suspects were identified as Syed Tahla Ahsan, Adel Abdul Bary and Khaled Al-Fawwaz.

            “Our family is whole again,” Smith wrote Wednesday, alongside a smiling picture of her young daughter, who disappeared from her tent on a camping trip almost three weeks earlier. 
    

            Police found the little girl at a locked home in the small town of Carnarvon, Western Australia, just after midnight Wednesday local time.
    

            A police video caught the moment an officer picked up the child and asked her, “What’s your name? The girl replied, “My name is Cleo,” according to police.
    

            “When she said ‘My name is Cleo,’ I don’t think there was a dry eye in the house,” Deputy Police Commissioner Col Blanch told 6PR radio.
    

            “I have seen seasoned detectives openly crying with relief. I am speechless, which is very rare … this is something we all hoped in our hearts, and it has come true.”
    

            The 4-year-old’s disappearance triggered a massive police search that initially covered several square kilometers around the remote campsite at Quobba Blowholes, around 950 kilometers (590 miles) north of Perth, and later extended nationwide as alerts were issued for sightings of the girl.
    

      
      

      

    

            The house where she was eventually found is just a short drive from the Smith family home. 
    

            A 36-year-old local man with “no family connection” is in police custody, WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson told ABC Radio Perth. 
    

            He was not in the house at the time of the raid, Blanch said, and is currently being questioned. Police don’t suspect anyone else of being involved, they said.

            US forward Carli Lloyd showed no signs of slowing down during her team’s 9-0 battering against Paraguay on Thursday night, scoring five goals despite 
 from professional football earlier this year. 
    

            The 39-year-old soccer star found the back of the net twice within the first six minutes of the friendly at FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio, before scoring two more in the first half. 
    

            Teammates Andi Sullivan and Lynn Williams also contributed to their side’s win to lead 6-0 against their opponents at half time. 
    

            Sullivan scored again barely five minutes after the second half whistle, while Lloyd finished her stellar performance with a header in the 61st minute.
    

            US striker Tobin Heath wrapped up her team’s victory by scoring the final goal of the match. 
    

            “That was fun,” Lloyd told ESPN in a post-match interview. “I’m just trying to savor it because I want time to go a little bit slower – because one game is down and I have three left.
    

            “Great game, good to be out there with my teammates, and you know, overall good performance,” she added.
    

            Lloyd, who is considered one of the greatest players to ever grace the women’s game, shared the news of her plans to retire in August 2021 
 by US Soccer.  
    

            When asked about her retirement earlier this week, she told ESPN, “It’s weird.”
    

            “When you get to this point, I don’t think anything can ever prepare you for this moment. It’s emotional, you know, I think I’m more mentally tired now than I ever have been. 
    

            “I’ve spent my entire career just flipping each chapter and getting ready for the next, and this chapter of playing professional soccer is something that I’ve been so passionate about,” she said. 
    

            “My first love is coming to an end, and so it’s very emotional. 
    

            “Every time I step onto the field, every time I finish a game, it just has a greater sense to it. I know I’m nearing the end, but I just want to soak it all up and just savor every moment I can,” she added. 
    

            With 313 appearances for the national team and 133 international goals under her belt, Lloyd has earned success after success over her 16-year career with the USWNT. 
    

            She will play her final games for the national team in three more friendly matches in September and October, while also completing the rest of the National Women’s Soccer League season with NJ/NY Gotham FC before stepping off the pitch.
    

            The news comes as the US Women’s national soccer team finds itself embroiled in an ongoing dispute with the US Soccer Federation over equal pay. 
    

            After the sport’s national governing body offered the women’s and men’s national teams identical contracts this week, the United States Women’s National Team Players’ Association (USWNTPA) called the proposal 

    

            The federation retorted, 
, “An offer on paper of identical contracts to the USWNT and USMNT, and to discuss equalizing prize money, is real, authentic and in good faith. A publicity stunt is a 90-minute one-sided movie.”

 against US Soccer, which was rejected 
 by federal judge Gary Klausner, on the basis that the women’s team competed in more games and earned more money than the men’s team. 
    

            Prior to that, key members of the USWNT, including Lloyd, initially filed a lawsuit demanding equal pay from the federation. 
    

            At the time Lloyd

54-ball hundred against Australia
Record 106 sixes in Tests
McCullum playing in final Test

            As memorable sporting farewells go, it will take some beating.
    

            New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum set a Test cricket world record 54-ball century as he smashed the Australian bowling attack to all corners of Christchurch’s Hagley Oval Saturday.
    

            It bettered the previous fastest ton of 56 balls, jointly held by West Indies ‘masterblaster’ Viv Richards and Pakistan’s Misbah-ul-Haq.
    

            “I was trying to hit every ball for four or six,” said McCullum, who also admitted he had been unaware of the record.
    
B. McCullum smashed a record breaking 145 from 79 balls as 
 were bowled out for 370 on Day 1 
 

            McCullum, making his final Test match appearance for the Black Caps, also hit six sixes in his innings of 145 runs from just 79 deliveries.  
    

            That took him clear of Australia’s Adam Gilchrist for the overall record number of sixes scored in Tests, McCullum now totaling 106.
    

            In the context of the game and the series, McCullum’s onslaught was all the more remarkable, coming to the wicket with his side in deep trouble at 32 for three wickets in 20 overs.
    

            He had a massive slice of luck having scored 39 when he was caught in the gully by Mitchell Marsh off James Pattinson, but he was called back when a TV replay showed the bowler had overstepped the line.
    
Cheers to Brendon McCullum for an awesome weekend so far!🙌🏿 
 
… 

            After the let off, McCullum showed no mercy to the Australia attack, sharing a 179-run stand off 110 deliveries with Corey Anderson as New Zealand totaled 370 runs in its first innings.
    

            Australia, which won the first Test by an innings, needs victory in the match to regain top spot in the world Test rankings, reaching 57 for one wicket at the end of a run-filled first day.
    
RECORD! 
No boundary ever was and ever will be big enough for this man... Brendon McCullum! 
 
 

            The 34-year-old McCullum, renowned for his fast scoring in competitions such as the Indian Premier League, is retiring from international cricket after the current round of matches against the Australians.
    

            In his only other Test on the Hagley Oval, a replacement for Lancaster Park, which was destroyed in a devastating 2011 Christchurch earthquake that claimed 185 lives, McCullum hit 195 runs off 134 balls.
    

            But this innings, which could be his last in Test cricket if New Zealand does not bat again, surpassed even that as he entered the record books in remarkable style.

 Francine Niyonsaba, who has an intersex condition, broke a world record on Tuesday. 
    

            The 28-year-old set a new 2,000m record at a Continental Tour Gold meeting in Zagreb, Croatia, breaking the previous record by more than two seconds. Niyonsaba finished with a time of 5:21.26, surpassing Genzebe Dibaba’s 2017 record. 
    

            Niyonsaba, a 2016 Rio Olympic Games silver medalist in the 800m, is one of the athletes 
 by World Athletics from competing in women’s races from 400m to one mile in distance because of what they consider to be her body’s elevated levels of naturally occurring testosterone, her sensitivity to the hormone, and her unwillingness to submit to medical interventions to alter those characteristics.  
    

            Niyonsaba 
 hyperandrogenism, a condition characterized by the natural production of more testosterone than women without the condition. 
    

            

    

            In order to compete, those athletes must lower their testosterone levels with medication or surgery, which World Athletics says is intended to “ensure fair competition.”  
    

            In 2019, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld World Athletics’ DSD rules when they were challenged by South African runner Caster Semenya. She lost a subsequent appeal and in February took her case to the European Court of Human Rights. That case is still pending.  
    

            Niyonsaba 
 in 2019 that requiring medical interventions of certain women in order to compete was a form of “discrimination.” 
    

            “It doesn’t make sense. For sure, I didn’t choose to be born like this. I love running, and I will not stop running.” 
    

            Niyonsaba has had an excellent 2021 so far, winning the 5,000m Wanda Diamond League title, as well as finishing fifth in the 10,000m at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. 
    

            And in the 2,000m event – a distance not run at the Olympics or the World Championships – in Zagreb, continued her excellent form, dominating the race. 
    

            

    

            Finishing four seconds ahead of second-placed Freweyni Hailu with a final lap of 63 seconds, Niyonsaba became the new world record holder in the distance.

            Tens of thousands of people gathered outside the Georgian parliament on Wednesday in the second day of protests in capital city Tbilisi over a draft
 that critics fear could drive a wedge between the Caucasian nation and Europe.
    

            Protesters could be seen waving the flag of the European Union – which Georgia applied to join last year – and those of the United States and Ukraine, as well as the Georgian flag. Social media videos also showed some protesters throwing stones at the building’s windows and attempting to break a protective barrier, with police deploying water cannon and tear gas. 
    

            The controversial bill would require organizations receiving 20 percent or more of their annual income from abroad to register as “foreign agents” or face heavy fines – a proposal that rights experts warn 
 to civil society in the country and damage its democracy.
    

            The ruling Georgian Dream party has 
 that the bill is modeled on US legislation, Reuters reports. But critics say it evokes 
 that forms the basis of draconian restrictions and requirements on organizations and individuals with foreign ties.
    

            The bill passed a first reading on Tuesday in the legislature and faces several further steps before becoming law. Its ultimate passage is considered likely, however, as the bill has strong support among lawmakers. 
    

            In a statement on Wednesday, the Georgian Interior Ministry called “on the protesters, organizers and political leaders not to go beyond the limits defined by the law on freedom of assembly and expression.” 
    

            At least 76 people have been arrested in connection to Tuesday’s protests.
    

            Georgia has long played a delicate balancing act between citizens’ pro-European sentiment and the geopolitical aims of its powerful neighbor, Russia. 
    

            But an EU statement Tuesday warned that the law would be “incompatible with EU values and standards” and could have “serious repercussions on our relations.”
    

            Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said she believed that the bill “looks very much like Russian politics.”  
    

            “There is no need for this law, it comes from nowhere. Nobody has asked for it,” Zourabichvili told CNN’s Isa Soares Wednesday.
    

            Zourabichvili has vowed to veto the bill. But supreme executive power lies with the government headed by Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili. 
    

            Georgia applied for EU membership in March 2022. Though it was not granted candidacy status, the European Council has expressed readiness to grant that status if Georgia implements certain reforms. 
    

            “For Georgia, there has been certain conditions that are very much linked to the democratic credentials for democratic reforms,” European Union Vice Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič told CNN.
    

            The bloc’s member states have since “had very intense discussions” about Georgia’s candidacy, Šefčovič said, speaking to CNN’s Richard Quest on Wednesday.
    

            The US has said it is “deeply troubled” by the bill, with State Department spokesman Ned Price on Wednesday describing it as “Kremlin-inspired.” 
    

            “Parliament’s advancing of these Kremlin-inspired draft laws is incompatible with the people of Georgia’s clear desire for European integration and its democratic development,” Price said. 
    

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile addressed Georgian protesters directly, thanking them on Wednesday for raising his country’s flag during the demonstrations and wishing them “democratic success.”
    

            “I want to thank everyone who has been holding Ukrainian flags in the squares and streets of Georgia these days,” Zelensky said. 
    

            “We want to be in the European Union and we will be. We want Georgia to be in the European Union, and I am sure it will be,” Zelensky added later. “We want Moldova to be in the European Union, and I am sure it will be. All free peoples of Europe deserve this.”

 agreement settlement with former players to end the use of race norms and demographic estimates based on race for scoring of diagnostic tests.

 the league and the players had reached an agreement to end the use of race norming, which assumed players being evaluated for neurocognitive impairment started with worse cognitive function if they were Black. 
    

      
      

      

    

            With the modifications to the concussion settlement approved by Brody, Black retired players who were denied payments for dementia can have previous tests rescored or file new claims, an attorney for Davenport and Henry said.
    

            “We are very pleased that the court has approved the settlement,” attorney Cyril V. Smith  said. “This is a huge win for Black NFL retirees. We believe that thousands of Black former players will benefit.”
    

            CNN has reached out to the NFL for comment.
    

            According to the 
released earlier this week, 2,078 of 3,322 monetary awards have been paid for early to moderate dementia (level 1.5 and 2 claims).

Tunisia 4-2 Zimbabwe
Senegal and Tunisia safely through to quarterfinals
Zimbabwe and pre-tournament favorite Algeria fail to progress

            The African Player of the Year will play no further part in this edition of the Africa Cup of Nations. 
    

            Despite a spirited performance against group-winner Senegal in Franceville, Riyad Mahrez and his Algeria teammates leave Gabon without a win to their name.
    

            It wasn’t supposed to end like this. Having made the last 16 of the 2014 World Cup, this golden generation had arrived in Gabon hoping to lift the AFCON trophy for the first time since 1990. 
    

            Instead it’s Senegal’s Lions of Teranga that progress from Group B unbeaten, after goals from Papa Kouly Diop and Moussa Sow canceled out a brace from Mahrez’s Leicester City teammate Islam Slimani. 
    

            

    

            

    

            As it happened, even victory wouldn’t have seen the Desert Warriors through to the quarterfinals. 
    

            Coach Georges Leekens had glumly admitted his players no longer had their destiny in their own hands after failing to beat unfancied Zimbabwe and Tunisia – and so it proved, as events elsewhere consigned Algeria to an early exit. 
    
GROUP B final standings: 
Senegal 🇸🇳 - 7 (+4)
Tunisia 🇹🇳 - 6 (+1)
Algeria 🇩🇿 - 2 (-1)
Zimbabwe 🇿🇼 - 1 (-4)
 
 

            The air of futility that could have lent to the occasion didn’t impact upon the action itself.
    

            Despite Senegal coach Alou Cisse making 10 changes with qualification guaranteed, both sides started with urgency, and barely ten minutes had passed before the game had its first goal.  
    

            Acquired from Sporting CP for over $30 million, Slimani is another big name this tournament will miss, and the Leicester City frontman was a constant menace, meeting a measured cross from Sofiane Hanni on the volley after deft play down the left. 
    

            Senegal responded – showcasing a strength in depth that could see Cisse’s men go far – as Diop’s volley bounced into the ground and past the despairing Malik Asselah just before half time. 
    

            At that stage, the Algerian contingent could not have been unaware of proceedings in Libreville, but both sets of players reentered the field for the second period with renewed vigor. 
    

            Mahrez – directly involved in five of the past eight AFCON goals scored by Algeria – looked determined to say goodbye on a high, teeing up Slimani for his second of the night. 
    

            There were initially doubts the ball had crossed the line but back came Senegal, and barely two minutes had passed before stand-in striker Moussa Sow had leveled things, capitalizing on a loose ball on the edge of the penalty area to fire home a low drive. 
    

            Slipped through by Hanni once again, Slimani could have won it for Algeria with just over ten minutes to play – sealing his hattrick in the process – but dragged his shot just inches wide with only the keeper to beat. 
    

            Victory in truth would only have papered over the cracks of a underwhelming tournament, and the Fennec Foxes go home with their tails between their legs. 
    

            Having rested the key players including Cheikhou Kouyate, Henri Saivet and Sadio Mane, Senegal’s Lions of Terranga march on to a quarterfinal tie against Cameroon in Franceville. 
    

            It could have been a nerve-wracking evening for Tunisia in the Gabonese capital of Libreville, but the Eagles of Carthage put in one of the performances of AFCON 2017 to comfortably qualify for the quarterfinals.
    

            Four first-half goals put a dominant Tunisia out of sight and established a lead which it never looked like relinquishing. 
    

            Tunisia knew a drew would be enough to see it qualify for the quarterfinals, while anything less than a win would see Zimbabwe exit the competition.
    

            The Warriors of Zimbabwe needed to begin positively but got off to the worst possible start, finding themselves a goal behind inside 10 minutes.
    

            Wahbi Khazri’s poor corner bobbled its way to the edge of the of the box and Naim Sliti was afforded the freedom of Libreville by Zimbabwe’s defense, before firing a shot which took two deflections to deceive goalkeeper Tatenda Mkuruva.
    

      
      

      

    

            And it wouldn’t be long before Tunisia doubled its lead. This time Sliti turned provider, threading an intricate through ball into the path of Youssef Msakni after some wonderful interplay between the pair.
    

            Msakni duly rounded off the move by slotting the ball low past Mkuruva.
    

            With 10 minutes remaining of the first half, Tunisia ended the match as a contest and with it the hopes of both Zimbabwe and Algeria.
    

            Once again, slack defending was Zimbabwe’s undoing as Taha Yassine Khenissi slid onto a low cross to turn the ball into the net.
    

            While crowds have been sparse at the best of times in Gabon, the attendance in the Stade d’Angondjé was so low – fewer than 2,000 – that the game’s atmosphere was reminiscent of a training match, belying its importance as a deciding clash in a major international tournament. 
    

            Far from letting their heads drop, though, the Warriors rallied. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Knowledge Musona cleverly cut in from the right, before drawing a smart save from Rami Jeridi.
    

            However, it wouldn’t be long before the Belgium-based striker gave his side a breakthrough – and with it a glimmer of hope.
    

            Musona’s clever chip took the ball past two Tunisian defenders and created space for him to fire a shot past Jeridi into the far corner.
    

            But any rekindled hope of a miraculous comeback was extinguished almost immediately.
    

            Costa Nhamoinesu, who in truth was fortunate to still be on the pitch after a succession of cynical fouls, was penalized for clumsily tripping Khenissi in the penalty area, giving the referee no choice but to point to the spot.
    

            Khazri stepped up and fired the ball low to the Mkuruva’s left, though the keeper will feel he could have done better after guessing the right way and getting a hand to the shot.
    

      
      

      

    

            If Tunisia thought the second half would be won at a canter, Zimbabwe provided an early reminder that it wasn’t finished in Gabon just yet. 
    

            Tendai Ndoro galloped onto Musona’s through ball and calmly poked the ball through the legs of the onrushing Jeridi.
    

            Though Zimbabwe did enjoy significant periods of dominance in the second half, a lack of quality and attacking cohesion meant Tunisia’s defense went largely untroubled.
    

            

    

            In the end, greater technical ability allowed Henryk Kasperczak’s side to wrest back control from Zimbabwe’s briefly tightening grip.
    

            The final scoreline does afford the Warriors a modicum of respectability, although Tunisia could – and should – have put the game beyond doubt.
    

            

    

            Safely through, the Carthage Eagles have five days to prepare for a quarterfinal clash against Burkina Faso.

Remains were found during an archaeological dig at the Vatican in the 1940s
They will be shown during celebrations to mark the end of Catholic church's ""Year of Faith""
St. Peter was the leader of the early Christian church, and the first Roman Catholic pope

            After centuries buried beneath the 
, and decades hidden away inside the Holy See, the bones of a man long believed to be St. Peter, one of the founding fathers of the Christian church, are on display for the first time.
    

            The controversial remains were revealed to the public on Sunday at a mass in St Peter’s Square marking the conclusion of the Catholic church’s “Year of Faith.” 
    

            
, the semi-official Vatican newspaper, Archbishop Rino Fisichella said the “relics which tradition recognizes as those of the apostle who gave his life for the Lord” would be exhibited as part of the service.
    

            
 reports that 8.5 million pilgrims have venerated the relics over the course of the year.
    

      
      

      

    

            But whether the bones, normally kept in an urn housed in the private chapel of the Pope’s own Vatican apartments, really are those of St. Peter, the fisherman-turned-disciple who became the first pope, is open to question.
    

    

            Tradition has it that St. Peter was martyred – by being crucified, upside down – in Rome in A.D. 64. before being buried in the city.
    

            In his book “The Vatican Diaries,” 
 wrote that “St. Peter’s tomb in the cemetery on the Vatican Hill became… a popular pilgrimage site,” prompting the emperor Constantine to build a basilica in his honor in the 4th century.
    

            The remains which will be revealed on Sunday were among those discovered during an archaeological dig begun on the site in 1939; in 1968 the then pope, Paul VI, declared that they had been identified “in a manner which we believe convincing.”
    

            But with no DNA evidence to conclusively prove their identity, whether they belong to St. Peter is likely to remain an enduring mystery.
    

            CNN’s Vatican analyst 
 says that like so much concerning religion, the belief that the bones are those of the disciple comes down to faith.
    

            “Like other famous relics, such as the Shroud of Turin or the Belt of Mary, they evoke awe and devotion regardless of their actual provenance,” 
. “Faith, as the Bible puts it, lies in ‘the evidence of things not seen.’”

Red Devils finish third, their best World Cup performance
Meunier & Hazard score

            Having previously contested the match 
, Belgium and England now squared up in the match neither side wanted to play.
    

            When these two teams last met, the outcome would determine which would finish top of Group G and consequently navigate the so-called ‘harder’ route to the final.
    

            The loser, however, would find itself on the easier side of the draw, avoiding the likes of Brazil, Argentina and France.
    

            In the end, the route to the final mattered little and both sides, having lost in their respective semifinals, found themselves in Saint Petersburg to contest the maligned third-place play-off, with Belgium coming out on top thanks to goals by Thomas Meunier and Eden Hazard. 
    

            

    

            

    

            Perhaps the players would have preferred to be on holiday after a long season, but it didn’t show in what was a blistering start to the game.
    

            England appeared to be dominating before a typically piercing Belgium counterattack saw Nacer Chadli square the ball for Meunier to tap in at the far post in the fourth minute. 
    

            Managers Gareth Southgate and Roberto Martinez had provided the pre-match fighting talk, pointing out that both sides could yet make their own history.
    

            Third place for England would have been the nation’s second-best performance at a World Cup, and the best on foreign soil.
    

            “We’ll either go home having shown improvement and equaled every team that has left our shores,” Southgate told ITV before the match. 
    

            “Or we put in a performance and go home with a medal and become the best ever team to have left our shores.”
    

            Third place for Belgium, meanwhile, would have been its highest finish in World Cup history.
    

            

    

            

    

            After Meunier’s opening goal, Belgium looked the more motivated, while everything England did appeared to be lethargic.
    

            In midfield, Kevin De Bruyne and Hazard ran the show, splitting England’s defense apart at will.
    

            Chances for Romelu Lukaku and another for Meunier came and went and England looked relieved to hear the half-time whistle, which prevented another Belgium corner.
    

            When the teams emerged after the restart, England – with the introduction of Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford for Danny Rose and Raheem Sterling – gradually got a foothold on the game.
    

            By the time the final 20 minutes came around, Belgium were hanging on for that bronze medal.
    

            After some intricate passing on the edge of the area, Eric Dier had his effort cleared off the line by Tottenham teammate Toby Alderweireld, before Thibaut Courtois smothered Harry Maguire’s header.
    

            But Belgium still posed a danger and another scintillating counterattack, arguably its best of the tournament so far, ended with Jordan Pickford producing a stunning save to deny Meunier his second.
    

            In the end, it was another counterattack which finished England off and it was the match’s two outstanding players who produced it. 
    

            De Bruyne’s threaded pass found Hazard in behind England’s defense and the Chelsea man slotted the ball inside Pickford’s near post.
    

            There were to be no goals for a quiet Harry Kane but the striker’s six goals look to be enough to win the golden boot, with only Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappe – both on three – within reach ahead of Sunday’s final.
    

            It was an anticlimactic way for both these teams – which have given their fans some thrilling moments in Russia – to end the World Cup, but Belgium’s ‘Golden Generation’ leave with bronze and a deserved piece of history.

            The NFL family has waited on tenterhooks this past week on the health of 
 as he continues to recover in hospital, but this weekend the show goes on and the final game week of the regular season still holds plenty of thrilling football.
    

            Hamlin collapsed during the first quarter of the Bills game at 
 on Monday, a contest that was 
 by the NFL on Thursday night.
    

            The canceled game leaves the Bills (12-3) – a win behind the Chiefs (13-3) in the hunt for the No. 1 seed and a bye in the next round. 
    

            The Bills will have to play their game against the Patriots (8-8) Sunday knowing that with a win and a Chiefs loss they could still clinch that top spot in the AFC thanks to a higher win percentage.
    

            Cincinnati Bengals quarterback
says he “probably wants to play” his team’s next game but also understands that others don’t in the aftermath of Hamlin’s collapse on Monday. 
    

            “I’m sure if you polled the locker room there would be mixed votes on that,” he told reporters. “Personally, I think playing is going to be tough, but there’s people that want to play, too, and there’s people that don’t.
    

            “Personally, I probably want to play. I think getting back to as normal as you can as fast as you can is personally how I kind of deal with these kinds of things. But like I said, everyone has a different way of dealing with it.”
    

            The Bengals have no chance of topping the AFC. At best, they could steal the Bills’ second spot if they beat the Ravens and the Bills lost.
    

            The flip side is that even if the Ravens beat the Bengals, thanks to a higher win percentage the Bengals will remain top of the AFC North.
    

            The Ravens have looked toothless these last few weeks in the absence of quarterback Lamar Jackson, but with an imperious defense and the Bengals potentially struggling to overcome the shock of Monday, there is an opportunity for the Ravens to move into the playoffs with some momentum
    

            The game gets underway at 1:00 p.m. ET on Sunday.
    

            For Tennessee and Jacksonville, the playoffs have come early.
    

            The winner takes a playoff spot and top spot in the AFC South, meanwhile the loser comes away with absolutely nothing.
    

            And it’s not looking great for the Titans, who lost a sixth game on the go when they were beaten 27-13 at home by the Cowboys.
    

            Things have been made worse by their situation at quarterback. Starter Ryan Tannehill is out injured. His replacement Malick Willis threw only 99 yards and was turned over twice against Houston, before he was replaced in their last game by Josh Dobbs.
    

            The 2017 draft pick has only played seven career NFL games and started a game for the first time against the Cowboys.
    

            The teams played against each other just four weeks ago, with the Jaguars coming out 36-22 on top on Tennessee soil. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence was on fire, throwing 368 yards and three touchdowns.
    

            Tune in at 8:15 p.m. ET on Saturday.
    

            Another game with everything to play for as the Packers, Lions and Seahawks all have an identical 8-8 record going into the final game.
    

            Because of previous results against each other, if the Packers win, they are through to the playoffs; if the Lions win, they will need a down-and-out Rams team to do them a favor and stop the Seahawks winning on home soil.
    

            This is also a game of two teams that have recovered from terrible starts (Packers were 3-6 and the Lions were 1-6) to finish the regular season in top form.
    

            The Packers have built their success on one of the meanest defenses in the NFL. They have won their last four games on the spin without conceding more than 20 points in any of them.
    

            Against the Packers is a Lions team scoring for fun. Detroit put 41 past Chicago last week with Jared Goff hitting top form, throwing 255 yards, three touchdowns and zero interceptions.
    

            The Packers will be praying for a Seahawks win as this is the final game on Sunday, meaning that the Lions could already be knocked out when they kick off in Wisconsin.
    

            But if the Rams pull off an upset, this game could have everything riding on it for both teams.
    

            Tune in at 8:20 p.m. ET on Sunday.
    

            A few weeks ago the Philadelphia Eagles looked unstoppable. They had only lost one game, had the best record in the NFL and practically sown up top spot in the NFC. 
    

            Fast forward to this weekend and the Eagles could potentially end the weekend in the five-seed after losing their last two games.
    

            The Cowboys are only one game behind the Eagles in the NFC East after beating them two weeks ago and could leapfrog them in the playoff table.
    

            Their fate is still in their hands however, but Philadelphia will be hoping that the Giants do them a favor by resting their starters.
    

            The Giants clinched an improbable playoff spot last week when they beat the Colts but, regardless of results, will come in six-seed and so face the age old question of whether to play or rest their best players.
    

            That bye is particularly important to an Eagles team who are desperate to give a full rest to star quarterback Jalen Hurts, who has been sensational for the Eagles but missed the two recent losses because of a shoulder injury.
    

            With the Cowboys facing relatively easy game against the Commanders, all eyes will be on the Eagles to see if they can turn around their mini-slump to end the season on a high, or lose all the momentum they have built up this season.
    

            The game gets underway at 4:25 p.m. ET on Sunday.

            England’s star player Lauren James has apologized for stepping on an opponent during the team’s Round of 16 game against Nigeria, a move that earned her a red card and elimination from at least one World Cup match.
    

            In what appeared to be a moment of madness, James stepped on the back of Nigeria’s Michelle Alozie and was sent off in the 87th minute of Monday’s match at Brisbane Stadium.
    

            After the game, which culminated in Nigeria losing a penalty shootout, Alozie took to Twitter Tuesday to share her respect for James despite the incident. 
    

            “We are playing on the world’s stage. This game is one of passion, insurmountable emotions, and moments. All respect for Lauren James,”

            “Also, for our England fans and my team-mates, playing with and for you is my greatest honor and I promise to learn from my experience.”
    

            The red card means James will miss England’s next game, Saturday’s quarterfinal against Colombia in Sydney, Australia.
    

            She could also be out of commission for subsequent games, should England progress. Receiving a red card results in an automatic one match ban, but the FIFA disciplinary committee can increase that if it sees fit.
    

            After James apologized personally, her team also issued a statement.
    

            “Lauren is really sorry for her actions which led to the red card and is full of remorse. It is wholly out of character for her,” the Lionesses 
. 
    

            “We will be supporting Lauren throughout and will be putting forward representation on her behalf. We fully respect FIFA’s disciplinary process and will not be making any further comment until after any decision has been made.”
    

            James initially received a yellow card for what appeared to be a petulant and deliberate decision to step on Alozie. After a review from the video assistant referee (VAR), the punishment was upgraded to a red card and she was sent off, leaving England to finish the match down a player. 
    

            In a press conference after the match, England coach Sarina Wiegman said James is “an inexperienced player on this stage and has done really well, and I think in a split second she just lost her emotions.” 
    

            “And of course she doesn’t want to hurt anyone. She’s the sweetest person I know, and things happen like that and you can’t change it anymore, so it’s a huge lesson for her to learn, but of course it’s not something that she really did on purpose.”
    

            Many have compared the situation to the 1998 Men’s World Cup, when David Beckham received a red card and was sent off for kicking out at Argentina’s Diego Simeone.

            She also ensured that police “will be out there on the waterways, including rivers dams, conducting compliance checks, drug and alcohol testing, and all the things that we do to make sure that the community is safe.”
    

            The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has warned about an increased number of whales around Australian waters this year and has advised swimmers and boaters to stay 100 meters away from a whale and 300 meters from a whale with a calf, according to Channel 7.

            Anadolu reported that Sutton hanged herself, citing Turkish security officials. Turkish authorities have not responded to CNN requests for comment.
    

            News of Sutton’s death caused an outpouring of grief on Twitter, with friends and former colleagues expressing skepticism she could have taken her own life and calling for a full investigation into her death. 
    

            “Simply don’t believe the news reports,” tweeted Jane Pearce, Iraq country director for the U.N. World Food Program, describing Sutton as a friend.
    
Mourning my friend & colleague jacky Sutton tonight. Simply don't believe the news reports.

            Sudipto Mukerjee, a former colleague of Sutton’s from the U.N. Development Program, tweeted that he found it “very difficult” to believe the reports of suicide.
    
Very difficult to believe that my colleague 
 staffer and seasoned traveler 
 committed suicide 

            Charlie Winter, a senior researcher at London-based counter-extremism organization Quilliam, wrote that he did not “for 1 second believe” that Sutton had taken her own life. “When we met on Monday she was engaging, driven; seemed anything but suicidal,” he tweeted.
    
I don't for 1 second believe that 
 killed herself. When we met on Monday she was engaging, driven; seemed anything but suicidal.

            The Melbourne, Australia-based International Women’s Development Agency tweeted it would “be seeking answers and calling for urgent action” over Sutton’s death.
    
Today, we are angry and grieving for Jacky Sutton. Tomorrow we’ll be seeking answers and calling for urgent action.

            John MacLeod, managing editor of the London-based Institute for War and Peace Reporting, told CNN that Sutton’s employer
was sending staff to Turkey to seek answers from officials. 
    

            MacLeod said he did not know what to think of suggestions her death could be attributed to something other than suicide.
    

            “We don’t honestly know,” he said. “Obviously the circumstances are unclear. … We will be looking to ask for a thorough investigation.”
    

            Sutton was appointed the organization’s acting country director in Iraq in June, replacing Ammar Al Shahbander, who died in a May car bomb attack in Baghdad. She had been in London last week
to attend a memorial service for Al Shahbander, the institute said.
    

            The organization added in a statement that Sutton “was returning to Iraq full of plans for innovative new work, including projects to counter violent extremism that threatens a country to which she was so committed.”

    

            “Jacky was one of the top development professionals working on Iraq, and she devoted nearly 10 years of her life to helping the country,” said Anthony Borden, the institute’s executive director.
    

            “She was extremely bright, highly competent, and well able to handle herself in difficult environments, and she was universally loved. We are in total shock.”
    

            Sutton spoke five languages, including Arabic, and had extensive experience in media and development fields, having worked for the BBC in Africa, the Middle East and the United Kingdom, and in senior roles for the United Nations from Afghanistan and Iran to Gaza and West Africa.
    

            She had recently been pursuing a doctorate on the position of female journalists in Iraq and Afghanistan, studying at the Center for Arab and Islamic Studies at the Australian National University in Canberra, the Institute for War and Peace Reporting said.

            Tongan flag-bearer 
 was brutally honest about his ambitions ahead of his Winter Olympics debut.
    

            “First step, finish before they turn the lights off,” he told reporters of his aims. “Don’t ski into a tree, that’s number two,” he added. 
    

            Happily, the 34-year-old Taufatofua avoided those pitfalls in the men’s 15-kilometer free cross country skiing event Friday.
    

            Having competed in Taekwondo at Rio 2016 and caused a stir by appearing oiled up and topless at the opening ceremony (a trick he repeated in 
), Taufatofua crossed the line in 114th position.
    

            That was just under 23 minutes behind gold-medal winner Dario Cologna from Switzerland. 
    

            Taufatofua then waited at the finish alongside fellow stragglers Sebastian Uprimny of Colombia, Morocco’s Samir Azzimani and Portugal’s Kequyen Lam as they welcomed Mexico’s German Madrazo who finished in 119th and last position.
    

            “Everyone was at the front racing to come first, we were racing not to come last, but we’ll have a good laugh over dinner,” Taufatofua later joked.
    

            “I’d rather be finishing towards the end of the pack with all my friends than in the middle by myself. We fought together, we finished together,” he added.
    

            Taufatofua has described just reaching the Games as a miracle.
    

            He rented skis to train in and only had 12 weeks of preparation time on snow ahead of Pyeongchang.
    

            Speaking before taking to the course, he described wanting to compete “because there are people who are inspired by this story.”
    

            “People are scared to fail, scared of criticism, scared of what their mum or dad will say about stuff and then they don’t do anything,” he said.
    

            

    

            

    

            Taufatofua now wants to compete at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, though he’s still mulling which sport.
    

            “That’s one of my goals. Three Olympics, three different sports, let’s see if it can be done, huh?”
    

            “Something to do with water. We’ll see. High jumping? Whoa. Right now staying warm would be my next sport.”

2012-11-09 18:10:00+00:00,,"Chelsea announces profit of $2.2 million for the period ending June 30, 2012
It is the first time the English club has been in black since Roman Abramovich took over
Russian has bankrolled Chelsea in recent years but new rules threaten to curb this
Club says it now has the fifth largest turnover of any team in Europe

            Chelsea’s onfield successes this year have led to the European soccer champions’ first financial profit during the nine-year reign of owner Roman Abramovich.
    

            The Russian billionaire has bankrolled the English Premier League club since buying it for a nominal fee in 2003, posting big losses every year since then as he has sanctioned spending sprees to sign some of the sport’s biggest players.
    

            Last year ended in a loss of £67.7 million ($108 million) but the figures up to June 30, 2012 reveal a profit of £1.4 million ($2.2 million).
    

            Chelsea also announced on Friday that it had made a record turnover of £255.7 million ($407 million) – which it said is the fifth largest of any European club.
    

            That was a boost of £33 million ($52 million) from last year, driven by the club’s first UEFA Champions League title and a profit on player sales of £28.8 million ($46 million).
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            The latter figure came despite offloading players such as Didier Droga, Nicolas Anelka and Salomon Kalou on free transfers while spending big on Juan Mata and Romelu Lukaku in that period.
    

            In comparison, Premier League rival Arsenal – which has a more prudent transfer policy – made a profit of £30.6 million ($48 million) on turnover of £243 million ($386 million) in figures released in September.
    

            Another key element in Chelsea’s finances is that £166.6 million ($265 million) of intergroup debt was capitalized into equity – effectively personal loans to the club written off by Abramovich – to leave the club debt free.
    

            Chelsea is one of the clubs under the financial spotlight following the implementation of UEFA’s new financial fairplay rules, which require teams to be self sufficient and limit the amount that benefactors such as Abramovich can spend with no expectation of return.
    

            If they don’t meet these targets, which are being phased in over a number of years, then clubs face expulsion from top European competitions.
    

            “The big challenge is always to have a successful team on the field that wins trophies and to make a profit at the same time,” said Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay.
    

            “The objectives have been set across the whole business, from the Academy to Under-21s and all the way through to the first team.
    

            “Our club philosophy is built on success. We had that success on the field this year, as we were the first London team to win the UEFA Champions League, and we enjoyed it off the field as well and this helps us inject financial investment into the team.”
    

            Chelsea has also sought to boost its income streams, signing a three-year global energy deal with Russian corporation Gazprom in July while also taking full control of its digital media operations.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “We’re in favor of Financial Fair Play,” manager Roberto di Matteo told reporters on Friday ahead of this weekend’s home clash with Liverpool.
    

            “We’re doing everything in our power to comply with the new rules, and this is great news for the club.
    

            “For the first time, we’ve been able to achieve a profit – also thanks to the success on field, but off field as well, with new sponsor deals and also the transfer market.
    

             “Going forward, I think that puts Chelsea in a strong position to remain competitive at domestic level but also international level.”
    

            It has been a mixed season so far for Chelsea, with impressive onfield performances marred by racism controversies.
    

            Captain John Terry has just completed a four-match ban for abusing a black opponent a year ago, while the club has lodged a complaint against EPL referee Mark Clattenburg over alleged racist remarks made to Nigerian midfielder John Obi Mikel.
    

            A Chelsea fan has also been arrested for making an alleged monkey gesture towards a Manchester United player during last week’s English League Cup match at Stamford Bridge.

            Wimbledon may be tennis’ oldest grand slam tournament, but its latest boost to prize money shows it’s moving with the times. 
    

            This year’s winners of the men’s and women’s singles competitions will pick up $3.06 million (£2.35 million) each as part of an 11.8 percent increase in the overall pot from $44.2 million (£34m) to $49.4 million (£38m).
    

            Even losing qualifiers or losers in the first three rounds will benefit from a $13,000 (£10,000) raise to their cheques.
    

            Last year, champions Novak Djokovic and Angelique Kerber pocketed $2.93 million (£2.25m) for winning the tournament.
    

            The US Open remains tennis’ richest payday, with Flushing Meadows handing out $3.89 million (£2.99m) to the singles champions.
    

            

    

            

    

            The Wimbledon organizer also announced that the new retractable roof on Court One – the venue’s second biggest arena – will be ready for the 2019 championships.
    

            The All England Club (AELTC) chairman Philip Brook, whose time in charge of the club will come to a conclusion at the end of 2019, spoke of his pride at the continuing growth of the year’s third major tournament, highlighting the purchase of land at the adjacent Wimbledon Park Golf Club, which represents a vital aspect of Wimbledon’s redevelopment and expansion plans.
    

            “The investment we have made in our estate, in the grass court season, in facilities for all of our guests both onsite and around the world, in prize money, in the surplus to the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), and in our staff, has resulted in strong foundations for the future of the Championships and of our sport as we plan for a new period of leadership,” he said in a statement.
    

            

    

            Last month, the AELTC announced an increase in the cost of the club’s exclusive five-year debenture tickets, with the passes going on sale for $105,000 (£80,000).
    

            As well as granting admission to every Centre Court game between 2021 and 2025, the debenture also potentially offers an unusual investment opportunity. One such case in February saw a pass-holder buy a five-year debenture for $66,149, before selling the final two years of the premium ticket for $138,892 three years later.

The EU's  27 member states will need 4-6 weeks to hammer out an initial negotiating position

            British Prime Minister Theresa May will trigger Article 50 on March 29, starting official Brexit negotiations between the UK and the European Union, her spokesman has confirmed. 
    

            The UK notified the EU on Monday of its intention to invoke Article 50 and will now prepare for a lengthy legislative and political program which promises to be anything but clear-cut.
    

            “Last June, the people of the UK made the historic decision to leave the EU. Next Wednesday, the government will deliver on that decision and formally start the process by triggering Article 50,” Brexit secretary David Davis said in a statement Monday.
    

            “We are on the threshold of the most important negotiation for this country for a generation,” he added. “The government is clear in its aims: a deal that works for every nation and region of the UK and indeed for all of Europe – a new, positive partnership between the UK and our friends and allies in the European Union.”
    

            In response, Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, 
 that he would present draft Brexit guidelines to the remaining 27 EU member states withing 48 hours. 
    

            Tusk’s spokesman, 
, told CNN that the EU will require between four to six weeks to consult with the other 27 member states and hammer out an initial negotiating position.
    

            The announcement comes a day after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker warned that other member states will “realize it’s not worth leaving” the EU after they see the deal the UK gets.
    

            The trigger day, which is next Wednesday, will come as the EU celebrates its 60th anniversary next week.
    

            The loss of Britain to the bloc has created speculation that other states might decide to follow suit, something Juncker strongly disagreed with in an interview published on Sunday.  
    

            “They will all see from the UK’s example that leaving the EU is a bad idea,” 
 told German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. 
    

            “On the contrary, the remaining member states will fall in love with each other again and renew their vows with the European Union.” 
    

            European leaders have stepped up their rhetoric over the past week as the start of negotiations draws nearer. 
    

            Last week, Tusk said the EU 
 from Britain that it would prefer to walk away from Brexit talks if it did not get its way.
    

            And Juncker reiterated that view, insisting Britain would have to get used to be on the outside, looking in.
    

            “Half memberships and cherry-picking aren’t possible,” Juncker told the German newspaper.
    

            “In Europe you eat what’s on the table or you don’t sit at the table.”
    

            May has already been fiercely criticized by Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has demanded a second referendum on Scottish independence.
    

            Sturgeon has made plain her view that Britain is heading for a “bad deal” on Brexit and wants Scotland to have a vote on independence before the terms of the deal are signed.
    

            She has accused May of failing to engage with her call for Scotland to remain in the European single market after Brexit, and that Scotland risks being taken out of the EU against its will.
    

      
      

      

    

            Sturgeon’s demand that the referendum be held between late 2018 and early 2019 was met with fierce criticism by May, who rejected the motion by saying it wasn’t the “right time” for such a vote.
    

            On Sunday, Sturgeon said she could revise her timetable for the referendum if May was willing to compromise.
    

            May, who last week declared that the UK is facing a “defining moment” in its history, will visit Wales Monday as she steps up her charm offensive.
    

            She was to hold meetings with Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones and Brexit Secretary David Davis and was expected to also visit Scotland and Northern Ireland in due course.
    

            “From my first day … I made clear my determination to strengthen and sustain the precious union. I have also been clear that as we leave the European Union I will work to deliver a deal that works for the whole of the UK,” May said in a statement before the visit.
    

             “I want every part of the United Kingdom to be able to make the most of the opportunities ahead and for Welsh businesses to benefit from the freest possible trade as part of a global trading nation.”

The world No. 1 also shot a 61 in the second round of the tournament in 2000 
Woods leads defending champion Keegan Bradley and Chris Wood by seven shots
Inbee Park, attempting to win four majors in a season, trails at the women's British Open

            Tiger Woods sizzled at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. With the season’s final major a week away, his timing is good. 
    

            Woods equaled his career-best round on the PGA Tour and matched his own course record in Ohio by shooting a 61, hitting an eagle, seven birdies and not dropping a shot. 
    

            He also shot a nine-under-par 61 in the second round of the tournament in 2000 – the year he outclassed his rivals and claimed three majors. 
    

            But Woods hasn’t won a major in five years now, stuck on 14, and struggled on the final day of the British Open last month when he was in contention. 
    

            

    

            The Bridgestone Invitational was the world No. 1’s first tournament since Muirfield, and he began with an impressive 66. 
    

            He bettered that on Friday at a tournament he has captured seven times, beginning with a birdie, eagle and birdie to set the tone. Woods shot the first nine in 30. 
    

            “I just let the round build from there,” Woods said in a television interview aired by Sky Sports. “I made a couple of key putts for pars. Things like that happen today.”
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            The back nine started just as well, with Woods registering four straight birdies. He was nine under through 13 holes. 
    

            With a sub 60 round in his sights, though, Woods shot at par the rest of the way, narrowly missing a birdie on the 17th but then avoiding a bogey on the 18th with a stunning putt.
    

            He leads defending champion Keegan Bradley and England’s Chris Wood by seven shots.  
    

            “It put me in a nice position going into the weekend,” said Woods. 
    

            The last time Woods shot a 61 at any tournament was at the 2005 Buick Open. 
    

            Before looking ahead to the PGA Championship, Woods was focusing on finishing the job at the Bridgestone Invitational. 
    

            Thunderstorms are expected Saturday. 
    

            “We got a long way to go,” said Woods. “The golf course will be certainly a lot different than it is now with the weather coming in so we’re going to have to make a few adjustments and see how it goes.”
    

            British Open winner Phil Mickelson was tied for 43rd. The slumping Rory McIlroy was tied for 25th alongside U.S. Open winner Justin Rose, 14 shots behind Woods. 
    

            
 
    

            At the women’s British Open at St. Andrews in Scotland, meanwhile, Inbee Park has work to do if she wants to become the first golfer in 83 years to claim four majors in a single season. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            

    

            Through two rounds on the Old Course, Park trails fellow South Korean Na Yeon Choi by eight shots after registering a 1-over-par 73 in blustery conditions. 
    

            She is tied for 22nd. 
    

            “A little bit of everything wasn’t really working well out there today,” Park told reporters. “I think I grinded (it out) really well out there. 
    

            “I was a bit unlucky with the draw, getting afternoon today, not playing in the morning when it’s lovely.”

            Smith covered the NBA for more than 20 years, including 11 years with Turner Sports, which, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia. 
    

            “The NBA mourns the passing of Sekou Smith, a beloved member of the NBA family. Sekou was one of the most affable and dedicated reporters in the NBA and a terrific friend to so many across the league,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. 
    

            “Sekou’s love of basketball was clear to everyone who knew him and it always shined through in his work. Our heartfelt condolences go to his wife, Heather, and their children, Gabriel, Rielly and Cameron,” Silver said.
    

            Smith started his career as a sports reporter at The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1994, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then worked four years each at The Indianapolis Star and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution before joining Turner Sports.
    

            Beloved in the basketball community, Smith’s death – on the anniversary of Kobe Bryant’s passing just one year ago – received numerous tributes from players and coaches alike.

            “I’ve never had anything but positive interactions and conversations with Sekou Smith,”

            “The Hawks organization is heartbroken by the passing of Sekou Smith. The Hawks’ beat writer for the AJC from 05-09, Sekou provided our fans with honest & fair coverage, sharing incredible insight on the team while establishing himself as one of the NBA’s top personalities,” 
.
    

            Lloyd Pierce, head coach of the Hawks, said in a postgame interview on Tuesday that it had been a tough day, with both Bryant’s anniversary and the news about Smith, calling him “about as genuine a person as there is in the industry.”

            First-team coach Andrew Gale, Director of Cricket Martyn Moxon and all members of 
 (YCCC) coaching staff have left, the team announced in a statement on Friday, amid an ongoing racism scandal’s fallout.
    

            Last month former cricketer Azeem Rafiq spoke to UK lawmakers about his calls for disciplinary action to be taken by YCCC following an investigation that found he had been subjected to racial harassment and bullying.
    

            Throughout the hearing, Rafiq shared his experience at Yorkshire and broke down in tears on more than one occasion.
    

            “From early on there was a lot of “You lot sit over there near the toilets,” the word ‘P***’ was used constantly, no one ever stamped it out,” said Rafiq.
    

            “All I wanted to do was play cricket. Towards the end of my first spell but constantly throughout I knew there was something wrong. I started taking medication for my mental health. It was really tough.”
    

            Asked to compare his treatment at Yorkshire to his everyday life, Rafiq said: “My every day life for as long as I’ve known has been cricket. It’s difficult to compare. Cricket is worse than society.”
    

            The club suspended Gale last month “pending a disciplinary hearing following a historical tweet,” whilst Moxon has been absent from work since early November “due to a stress-related illness.”
    

            “Significant change is required at Yorkshire County Cricket Club and we are committed to taking whatever action is necessary to regain trust,” 
 Kamlesh Patel, the new chair and director of Yorkshire.
    

            “The decisions announced today were difficult to make, but are in the best interests of the Club.
    

            “Without making important changes to how we are run, we cannot move on from the past to become a culture which is progressive and inclusive.
    

            

    

            “We are determined to learn from the mistakes of the past to become a Club which people can trust,” added Patel.
    

            The club said a new director of cricket would be appointed in the coming days, alongside a new coaching team which is being recruited.
    

            “We welcome the announcement by Yorkshire County Cricket Club on the departure of its entire coaching staff,” said Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Chair Julian Knight.
    

            “The experience of Azeem Rafiq at YCCC demanded no less,” added Knight.

Beats Roger Federer 6-3 6-4 in final
11th title of year for Serbian
Fifth ATP World Tour finals crown, fourth in row

            Novak Djokovic rounded out one of the most dominant seasons in the history of tennis by winning the ATP World Tour Finals in London Sunday with a straight sets dismissal of Roger Federer.
    

            The three-time defending champion beat his long-time rival 6-3 6-4 in a one-sided title match at the O2 Arena which lasted just 81 minutes.

            But Djokovic adopted more aggressive tactics for the final: “I had to change something,” he admitted after sealing victory when Federer double faulted.
    

            Djokovic has landed three grand slams, a record sixth Masters 1000 titles and now the lucrative finale to the ATP season to cap a remarkable 2015 which he recently admitted has been his best.
    

            

    

            Federer, who would have gone to world number two above Britain’s Andy Murray with victory, forced an early break point in the first game, but soon fell behind as Djokovic broke at 1-1.

            Djokovic had to save a further break point in the fifth game, but wrapped up the set as he broke through again on the Federer service while leading 5-3.
    

            It gave him the crucial advantage of serving first in the second set and he did not face another break point as he led from the front.
    

            

    

            By contrast, Federer was coming under more constant pressure on his own delivery, and he finally cracked in the 10th game. 
    

            Djokovic is the first man to win four straight ATP World Tour Finals and also took the crown in 2008.  He has also drawn level with Federer in their head to head at 22 wins apiece and has a remarkable 82-6 win record for the year. 
    

            “It could not have been a better finish to what has been a very long season but the best of my life,” he said.
    

            He will now take a break before beginning preparations for a crack at his 11th grand slam title as he defends his Australian Open crown in January. 
    

            Seventeen-time grand slam champion Federer, who pulled out of last year’s final against Djokovic with a back injury, conceded he had lost to the better man.

            The landscape of college sports continues its drastic change. 
    

            The Pac-12 Conference is down to only four schools remaining as the University of Arizona, Arizona State University and the University of Utah announced Friday they are leaving to join the Big 12 Conference.
    

            “We are thrilled to welcome Arizona, Arizona State and Utah to the Big 12,” conference commissioner Brett Yormark 
 on Friday. “The Conference is gaining three premier institutions both academically and athletically, and the entire Big 12 looks forward to working alongside their presidents, athletic directors, student-athletes and administrators.”
    

            The University of Oregon and the University of Washington will officially leave the Pac-12 and join the Big Ten Conference starting in 2024, both schools announced earlier Friday.
    

            The decision by the schools to change conferences coincides with the end of the Pac 12’s media rights deal with ESPN and FOX, and marks the latest shift in the collegiate sports landscape jumpstarted by UCLA and USC announcing last year 
 at the start of the 2024-25 season. 
    

            The decision to leave after the conclusion of the Pac-12’s media rights deal saves the schools from having to pay any exit fee. 
    

            “Today’s news is incredibly disappointing for our student-athletes, fans, alumni and staff of the Pac-12 who cherish the over 100-year history, tradition and rivalries of the Conference of Champions,” the Pac-12 said 
 “We remain focused on securing the best possible future for each of our member universities.”
    

            As part of the decision for the move, Ray Anderson, Arizona State vice president for university athletics, highlighted the financial package and stability of the Big 12.
    

            “The financial package is strong. The stability of the Big 12 is strong. We are ready, and the timing is right,” said Anderson. “The exposure and visibility as well as the resources from the conference will help us compete for championships. From enhancing our ability to recruit Texas for football to the Big 12’s strength in basketball, good days are ahead.”
    

      
      

      

    

            With the impending addition of the four schools expected ahead of the 2024 college football season, the Big 12 is set to expand from 12 teams to 16 teams, marking a bounce back for the conference after the University of Oklahoma and the University of Texas announced they were leaving to join the SEC earlier this year. 
    

            “We are excited for this new chapter, a move that is necessary to remain competitive in top-tier Division 1 athletics,” said Arizona State president Michael Crow. “We are joining a premier athletic conference and bringing with us programs on the rise, our rich traditions and history, and the metro Phoenix media market. We’re in a good spot, and we are pleased to be with UArizona and Utah in the move.”
    

            University of Utah president Taylor Randall thanked the Pac-12 
, saying, “I am grateful for all of the hard work my Pac-12 Conference colleagues invested in an effort to find solutions to keep the conference whole and provide a pathway forward to benefit all of our students, fans and communities. 
    

            “Ultimately, stronger forces within national collegiate athletics and the greater media landscape brought us to today’s decision. I am hopeful the relationships we have made over the past 12 years within the Pac-12 remain strong.” 
    

            The Big Ten Council of presidents/chancellors voted unanimously on Friday to approve Oregon and Washington to the conference effective August 2, 2024. 
    

            “We are excited to welcome the University of Oregon and the University of Washington to the Big Ten Conference,” Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti said in a 
. “We look forward to building long-lasting relationships with the universities, administrators and staff, student-athletes, coaches and fans. Both institutions feature a combination of academic and athletic excellence that will prove a great fit for our future.”
    

            There have now been four schools to leave the Pac-12 conference for the Big Ten since last year. The two southern California powerhouses – USC and UCLA – both announced they would join the Big Ten for the start of the 2024-2025 season. Last month, 
 the school would leave the Pac-12 for the Big 12.
    

            “Accepting membership into the Big Ten Conference is a transformational opportunity for the University of Oregon to change the short and long-term trajectory of our university and athletics department,” Oregon athletic director Rob Mullens said in a 
. 
    

            “The stability and exposure of joining the Big Ten is of great benefit to the University of Oregon, and we are grateful to the Big Ten presidents and chancellors for accepting our application to join the conference. We look forward to the opportunity for our student-athletes to compete in this conference, which includes many of the best programs in the nation in every sport.”
    

            Both schools were charter members of the Pac-12 dating back to 1915. 
    

            “We have tremendous respect and gratitude for the Pac-12, its treasured history and traditions. At the same time, the college athletics landscape has changed dramatically in recent years,” Washington athletic director Jennifer Cohen said in a 
. “The Big Ten’s history of athletic and academic success and long-term stability best positions our teams for future success, and we are energized at the opportunity to compete at the highest level against some of the best programs in the country.”
    

            Washington State University, Oregon State University, UC Berkeley and Stanford University are the four remaining Pac-12 schools which have not announced any conference changes. 
    

            WSU president Kirk Schulz and director of athletics Pat Chun said in a 
, “We are disappointed with the recent decisions by some of our Pac-12 peers.”

            Russian authorities must release the 24 Ukrainian sailors who were captured last year after entering the Kerch Strait, a United Nations maritime tribunal has ruled.

            Ukraine said two of its small gunboats and one tugboat were attacked after entering the Kerch Strait en route to the city of Mariupol. Russia said the Ukrainian ships illegally entered Russia’s territorial waters, carrying out dangerous maneuvers.
    

            The UN International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea said Russia must release the sailors immediately and urged both nations to not escalate the conflict. 
    

            “The actions taken by the Russian Federation could irreparably prejudice the rights claimed by Ukraine to the immunity of its naval vessels and their servicemen,” said Jin-Hyun Paik, the tribunal’s president. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Ukraine has asked for the sailors’ release, but Russia has not yet taken notice of the country’s requests or attended public hearings on the case, the tribunal said.
    

            Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Olena Zerkal said she expects Russian authorities to comply with the tribunal’s order. 
    

            “The order of the Tribunal is a clear signal for Russia that it cannot violate international law with impunity,” she said, according to Ukrainian state-run news agency Ukrinform.
    

            Russian officials did not attend the tribunal’s hearing and only sent a note through the Russian Embassy in Germany saying the country does not believe the tribunal has jurisdiction to review the incident, Russian state-run news agency TASS reported.
    

            The Kerch Strait – a shallow, narrow stretch of water just 2 to 3 miles wide at one point – connects the Azov Sea with the Black Sea and runs between the Crimean Peninsula and Russia. It is an important economic lifeline for Ukraine, as it allows its ships to access the Black Sea.
    

            It’s also the closest point of access for Russia to Crimea, a peninsula Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014. A Russian-built bridge over the Kerch Strait opened last year.
    

            Russia and Ukraine have been locked in long-simmering conflict since the annexation of Crimea, and a war with Russian-backed separatists in the country’s east has claimed more than 10,000 lives. Russia has also backed separatists in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.​

            Buckle up for the trial of the century.
    

            An 
between two of Britain’s most prominent footballers’ wives is heading for a dramatic courtroom showdown, after Rebekah Vardy sued Coleen Rooney for defamation.
    

            Vardy filed legal proceedings against Rooney on June 12, court documents show, months after Rooney posted a lengthy message on social media accusing someone using Vardy’s account of leaking stories about her to tabloid newspapers.
    

            The alleged subterfuge of one of the UK’s leading “WAGs” – a term used to describe the wives and girlfriends of professional footballers – against another quickly became something of a national obsession.
    

      
      

      

    

            It will come to a head in Vardy vs. Rooney, with the claimant suing Rooney under defamation law.
    

            Rooney’s legal team told CNN on Wednesday that their client had attempted to set up a meeting with Vardy in which she would present her evidence directly, before Vardy filed her case.
    

            “It is disappointing that Mrs Vardy has chosen to issue court proceedings. Coleen feels that the time and money involved could be put to better use; her offer to meet face to face still stands,” a spokesperson for law firm Brabners said. 
    

            But the firm suggested the case means more details will reach a British public already on tenterhooks. “Mrs Vardy’s decision to issue court proceedings does at least mean that Coleen’s evidence can be made public when the time is right,” the spokesperson said.
    

            Vardy’s legal team has not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment.
    

            Vardy is the wife of Leicester City and former England striker Jamie, while Rooney is married to England’s all-time leading goalscorer Wayne. Both women are also television personalities. 
    

            The court case follows a dramatic spat that unfolded in October 2019 following a social media post by Rooney.
    

            “This has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it,” she wrote.
    

            Attached to the post was a lengthy and gripping tale, in which Rooney described months of amateur detective work she conducted on Instagram to find out who was leaking stories about her to a British tabloid.
    

            “Over the past five months, I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper,” Rooney explained. “And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.”
    

            “I have saved and screenshotted the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them,” she went on.
    

            Then, in a jaw-dropping twist delivered at the end of a tantalizing ten-dot ellipses, Rooney wrote: “It’s ……….Rebekah Vardy’s account.”
    

            The allegation went viral and prompted countless column inches in the UK, quickly becoming known as the “WAG wars” and “WAG-gate.” Rooney’s sleuthing also earned her the nickname “WAGatha Christie.”  
    

            Vardy subsequently denied the allegations and suggested someone else may have used her account.
    

            But the fight turned brutal as celebrities and members of the public alike started taking sides. 
    

            Vardy was asked in an interview by the Daily Mail whether the two women have argued about the incident. “That would be like arguing with a pigeon,” she replied. “You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong, but it’s still going to s**t in your hair.”
    

            It is unclear when the court case will take place, or even whether it will bring an end to the drama.

            After retiring from competitive athletics in 2017, former sprinter Usain Bolt is turning his hand – or foot – to professional football and is in negotiations to participate

            In addition to his Olympic success he also holds 11 World Track and Field Championships titles, and currently holds the world records in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m.
    

            The news of Bolt’s interest in A-League football came as Aussie legend Tim Cahill announced his retirement from the international game.

Winning goal by Bafetimbi Gomis 
Gomis has scored nine in 10 EPL games
Kevin de Bruyne signs for Man City

            Reported Manchester United transfer target Bafetimbi Gomis sunk Louis van Gaal’s team with his ninth goal in 10 English Premier League matches as Swansea won 2-1 at its Liberty Stadium Sunday.
    

            United took the lead through Juan Mata just after the halftime break, but was stunned by goals from Andre Ayew and Gomis to slip to a first league defeat of the season.
    

            The Red Devils were hoping to move into second spot behind city rival Manchester City with a win and all looked well when Mata connected with a Luke Shaw cross to put the visitors ahead.
    

            Swansea defender Ashley Williams was at fault as he hesitated for the goal but he was to redeem himself almost immediately.
    

            He intercepted a sloppy pass from Wayne Rooney and charged forward before finding Gylfi Sigurdsson, whose cross was well met by Ayew to equalize.
    
""We are very disappointed,"" 
 goalscorer Juan Mata tells Sky Sports. ""We lost the game in five minutes."" 

            Summer signing Ghana international Ayew then set up the winner with a delightful pass for Gomis to beat Sergio Romero with a low shot.
    

            The United goalkeeper, replacing Real Madrid target David de Gea in the early season games, might have prevented the goal as Gomis scored for the fourth straight game from the start of the season.
    

            United sought a late equalizer, but Rooney, who spurned a couple of first half openings, was again at fault as he looked set to score but delayed too long and Williams nipped in to make a saving tackle.
    

            It was unheralded Swansea’s third straight win over United, lifting the Welsh side to fourth in the early standings.
    

            Rooney, despite his midweek hat-trick as Manchester United progressed into the Champions League, is enduring a lean patch in club football and has not scored in 10 Premier League games, dating back to April.
    

            United’s lack of goals, just three in four EPL games, may increase the pressure on van Gaal to target a striker before the transfer window closes this week, with the 30-year-old Gomis one of a number of targets being mentioned.
    

            But the Dutchman did not believe this was the problem in the Swansea defeat.
    

            “We were 1-0 ahead and dominating the game,” van Gaal told the club’s TV channel.

Atthaya Thitikul wins Thailand Championship 

            She took up golf at the age of six and just eight years later Atthaya Thitikul finds herself as the youngest winner of a professional golf tournament.
    

            The 14-year-old Thitikul entered the final day of 2017 Ladies European Thailand Championship two strokes behind leader Ana Menendez, but after the Mexican dropped four shots in the opening nine holes, the Thai teenager took control, winning the event by two shots.

Federer's Switzerland beats US in Perth

            Roger Federer was on the winning side in his historic mixed doubles match against fellow tennis great Serena Williams at the Hopman Cup Tuesday, but in the end the result hardly mattered.
    

            Paired with Belinda Bencic, Federer beat Williams and Frances Tiafoe 4-2 4-3 (5-3) to give Switzerland a 2-1 win over the United States in their round robin match.
    

            More importantly, it was the first and probably last time that  fans would get to see the two tennis players, widely regarded as the greatest of all time, battle it out across the net in a competitive match – and after it was over they even had time to pose for a selfie that is sure to go viral.
    

            Federer eventually clinched it for the reigning champion by claiming the winning point in the truncated tiebreak used in mixed doubles with a perfect angled volley.
    

            The Swiss maestro had talked before the match of his nervousness at facing the feared Serena serve and his fears seemed confirmed as he was unable to cope with two deliveries in her opening service game, but thereafter he took control of the match with Bencic.
    

      
      

      

    

            “I was nervous returning because it’s a wonderful serve and you just can’t read it,” said Federer in the post-match interviews.
    

            “It was great fun and she is a great champion. You can see how focused she is and that’s what I love about her.”
    

            In truth, Serena was not given the chance to show much of the doubles prowess that has seen her win 16 grand slam titles in that discipline on top of her 23 in singles.
    

            Partner Tiafoe lost his service for the Americans to lose the opening set and she also appeared to be nursing a right shoulder injury although she insisted it was of no concern with the Australian Open looming.
    

            However, despite the disappointing defeat which leaves the United States unable to reach the final of an event it has won six times, Serena clearly relished testing herself against Federer.
    
Oh what a night 🎾🔥 

            “It was a great experience, I’m sad it is over, I was just warming up,” she joked.
    

            Serena also had no doubt as to the status of the 20 grand slams winner.
    

            “I mean the guy is the greatest of all time, both on and off the court,” she said.
    

            The widely-anticipated clash has been the highlight of the 31st staging of the Hopman Cup with a record 14,029 packing into the Perth Arena to see the match-up.
    

            Switzerland will defend its unbeaten record against Greece in its final round robin match Thursday with the US taking on Britain.
    

            Earlier, Williams had shown her competitive mettle by coming through a testing singles encounter with Bencic to level the tie at 1-1 after Federer’s 6-4 6-1 straight sets win over Tiafoe.
    

            Leading 4-1 in the first set, Williams looked set to be cruising to a comfortable victory until her 21-year-old opponent hit back to win the next five games and take the opener.
    

            Williams, tuning up for the first grand slam of the season, upped her game under pressure to take the next two for a 4-6 6-4 6-3 victory to set up a competitive finale with Federer.
    

            “It was definitely a relief. She played really well. I knew I could play better,” she said.
    

            Federer had also looked in fine form as he looks to defend his Australian Open crown, gaining a single break to take the first set against his 20-year-old opponent and then racing through the second.
    

            Meanwhile in regular WTA action, Serena’s elder sister Venus showed she is still a force by beating Victoria Azarenka 6-3 1-6 6-3 in a battle of former world number one’s at the Auckland Classic.
    

            The pair were on court for over two hours in their first round match before Venus broke through in the sixth game of the decider to set up victory. “Maybe one of the toughest first round matches I have played,” she said.
    

            In Brisbane, Naomi Osaka, who beat Serena Williams in their controversial US Open final last September, showed she will be a force as she bids to win successive grand slams, reaching the quarterfinals with a 6-3 6-2 win over Destanee Aiava.

            The 
 revealed just how difficult life in the spotlight can be in an emotional documentary broadcast in the UK on Sunday. 
    

            Filmed during the pair’s 
, Harry and Meghan opened up in a way we rarely see from the British royal family, offering a unique glimpse into their lives and the institution itself. 
    

            The hour-long documentary for British channel ITV, called “Harry & Meghan: An African Journey,” made for gripping television with many taking to social media to express support and sympathy for the couple. 
    

            It is expected to be screened in the US this week but, for now, here’s a rundown of what we learned about Harry and Meghan from the program. 
    

            
 acknowledged 
 for the first time, saying they are on “different paths.”
    

            In one candid interview, ITV’s Tom Bradby asked the Duke of Sussex about media reports of a split with his brother. 
    

            While he didn’t outright declare that he was on the outs with William, he also didn’t deny that there was a rift. 
    

            “Part of this role, part of this job, this family, being under the pressure which it’s under, inevitably stuff happens. But we are brothers. We will always be brothers,” Harry explained.
    

            “We are certainly on different paths at the moment, but I will always be there for him, and as I know he will always be there for me. We don’t see each other as much as we used to as we are so busy. But I love him dearly and you know the majority of the stuff is probably – well, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing. But as brothers, you have good days and you have bad days,” he said.
    

            Another moment came when Meghan spoke of first meeting Harry and her friends weighing in on the new relationship.
    

            
 told Bradby that her friends were “so happy because I was so happy,” but added that her British friends warned her against marrying the prince. 
    

            The duchess recalled how they told her: “I’m sure he’s great but you shouldn’t do it – the British tabloids will destroy your life.”
    

            Meghan said that she “very naively” underestimated the tabloids as she was unfamiliar with them being American, adding: “I didn’t get it.” 
    

            One element to the documentary that had many on social media talking was the couple’s unfiltered admissions that they have been struggling. 
    

            Meghan fought back tears as she tried to explain the pressure she has encountered as a newlywed and new mom. 
    

            “Any woman, especially when they’re pregnant, you’re really vulnerable, and so that was made really challenging,” Meghan said. “And then when you have a newborn, you know. And especially as a woman, it’s a lot. So, you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed.”
    

            Clearly trying to find the right words to convey herself, Meghan then thanked Bradby for asking if she was alright in the wake of the intense media scrutiny. 
    

            “Thank you for asking. Not many people have asked if I’m OK, but it’s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,” she said.
    

            Pressing on, Bradby asked Meghan whether that meant she wasn’t OK, and that it “really” had been a struggle, the former actress replied simply with one word: “Yes.”
    
ITV's 
 spoke to Meghan as he gained exclusive access to the royal couple as they toured Africa for 10 days with their son Archie.
The documentary, Harry & Meghan: An African Journey, airs on Sunday at 9pm on 
 
 
 

            Separately, when asked if he feels at peace over the death of his mother, Diana, 22 years ago, Harry described his 

    

            “I think being part of this family, in this role and this job, every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,” he told Bradby. “So in that respect, it’s the worst reminder of her life as opposed to the best.” 
    

            The duke also said that the pressures of his life and the toll it took on his mental health required “constant management.”
    

            Harry seemed to be standing firm in his 
, telling Bradby: “I will not be bullied into playing the game that killed my mum.”
    

            At the beginning of October, the Duke of Sussex published a deeply personal statement slamming the UK tabloids for conducting what he called a “ruthless campaign” against his wife, Meghan.
    

            Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Duchess of Sussex was 
 for unlawfully publishing private correspondence with her father while editing it to change its meaning. The newspaper has denied the accusation, saying it was Meghan’s father who asked for the letter to be partially released. 
    

            Separately, Harry has joined a legal action against the publishers of 
 over alleged phone hacking.
    

            While there were many moving moments, there were also some sweet ones too. Whether it was seeing more from behind the scenes of baby Archie’s introduction to Archbishop Desmond Tutu or Meghan revealing her nickname for her husband – H.
    

            “In all honesty I have said for a long time to H – that is what I call him – it’s not enough to just survive something, that’s not the point of life. You have got to thrive,” she said, breaking into a smile as she said her husband’s moniker.

            Catalan independence protesters clashed with police outside the Camp Nou Wednesday as Barcelona hosted Real Madrid in El Clasico.
    

            The match between the two bitter rivals, one of the most-watched games in the world, had been postponed from its original October date by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) after lengthy jail sentences handed to pro-independence politicians sparked furious protests across the region.
    

            Local emergency services said 46 people were injured in Wednesday’s clashes, with eight requiring hospital treatment. Police said five people had been arrested, according to the AFP news agency.
    

            Masked protesters set up barricades using bins in the middle of the street and set them on fire, before throwing projectiles at police.
    

            

    

            

    

            During the match, which finished 0-0, fans caused a brief stop to play after throwing balls onto the pitch. They also held up banners that read: “Spain, sit and talk” and “Freedom, rights, self-determination.”
    

            These were the first violent clashes since October, when nine of the Catalan independence leaders were given between nine and 13 years for their part in a failed 2017 attempt to split from Spain.
    

            Three other defendants were found guilty of disobedience, fined and banned from public office for 20 months.
    

            In 2017, Barcelona was forced to play its La Liga match against Las Palmas behind closed doors at the Camp Nou after Catalonia’s disputed independence referendum descended into violence.
    

            Las Palmas indicated that it opposed the breakup of Spain, sending its players onto the pitch with small Spanish flags sewn onto their jerseys.
    

            Barcelona’s players took to the field wearing red and yellow shirts, the colors of Catalonia, before reverting to its normal strip for the match.
    

            Wednesday’s draw left Barcelona and Madrid level on 36 points at the top of La Liga.

Softer compounds and new constructions to increase overtaking and pit stops 
Tires will officially make 2013 debut at testing in Jerez, Spain at beginning of February
First F1 race of season is in Melbourne, Australia on March 17

            Changes to tires will make Formula 1 racing faster with more overtaking in 2013, according to the sport’s official tire supplier Pirelli. 
    

            Unveiled at the Italian company’s 
 on Thursday, the new look tires include softer compounds and new constructions which could lower lap times by up to 0.5 seconds, the company says.  
    

            Pirelli say the objective of the changes to the “P-Zero” dry weather tires and the wet 
range is “to improve performance and increase thermal degradation, to ensure at least two pit stops per race and open up more strategic options for all the teams.”

            “Through accumulating more information with each grand prix last year, the teams eventually fully understood the tires, after a spectacular start with seven winners from the first seven races. The result at the end of the year was races with less competition and sometimes only one pit stop. This phenomenon was also observed in 2011, disappointing many fans … ” he added.
    

            “Our 2013 range of tires mixes up the cards once more to help overtaking and ensure two to three pit stops per race.”   
    

            Color changes to the tire sidewalls have also been made with orange replacing silver to denote hard compound tires. 
    

            Pirelli say the teams were given the chance to sample the new compounds during free practice in Brazil last November but the tires will make their official debut at Formula 1 testing in Jerez at the start of February.

            It was one of the strangest episodes in military history, an event so unusual that it was first treated as a myth.
    

            At 8:30 pm on Christmas Eve of 1914 in the dank and muddy battlefields of northern Europe during World War I, a British soldier dispatched a report to headquarters: German soldiers have illuminated their trenches and are singing carols while wishing British soldiers a merry Christmas. 
    

            British officers ordered their men to be silent, but it was too late. A British soldier responded with his own chorus of “The First Noel.” A German soldier called out across No Man’s Land – the barbed wire-strewn, deadly middle ground separating the armies – “Come out, English soldier; come out there to us.” 
    

            The soldiers climbed out of their trenches and met in the middle. So did others, gathering to exchange chocolate, wine and souvenirs. They even organized a soccer game, which the Germans won 3-2.
    

            Most of the soldiers who shook hands on that fog-shrouded Christmas Eve would be dead before the war ended four years later. But letters from survivors and grainy black-and-white photographs prove it was no myth. An
 100,000 soldiers on both sides simply refused to fight because they were too exhausted and jaded. The Christmas Truce even lasted until New Year’s in some places. 
    

            “By December 1914, the men in the trenches were veterans, familiar enough with the realities of combat to have lost much of the idealism that they had carried into war in August, and most longed for an end to bloodshed,” according to an 
 of the Christmas Truce in Smithsonian Magazine.
    

            More than a century later, there’s little chance that Russian and Ukrainian soldiers will shower each other with gifts this winter. But the Christmas Truce story is an example of a peculiar feature of war that offers a warning to the beleaguered Russian army in Ukraine:
    

            There are moments throughout history where entire armies suddenly stop fighting, though they are evenly matched or even numerically superior to their enemy.
    

            What causes armies to lose the will to fight? And how might that play out with the Russian army in Ukraine? 
    

            This is the question that CNN asked combat veterans and military historians. While history is full of embattled armies like the Imperial Japanese  Army in World War II, which fought with ferocious intensity even though they knew they would not win, it also records other armies that “quiet quit” — stopped attacking the enemy or did the bare minimum to stay alive. 
    

            Russia’s troops may be approaching that precipice, says 
, a combat veteran of the Gulf War and a visiting professor of international security studies at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania.
    

             He says it’s become clear that the Russian army is poorly trained and supplied, and that its soldiers in many cases have lost their will to fight.
    

            “Fear and panic are more infectious than Covid” for an army, says McCausland, co-author of 

    

            The sources for both fear and panic are varied. But McCausland and other historians say that throughout the history of warfare, there are at least three reasons why armies lose the will to fight. 
    

            McCausland has seen a broken army lose the will to fight up close.
    

            He says he commanded a battalion during the Gulf War in 1990-1991 and saw so many Iraqi soldiers surrender that his unit had trouble accommodating the prisoners. They ended up giving water to the captured soldiers and pointing them toward the rear. 
    

            The war started when the Iraqi Army under Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. But many Iraqi soldiers simply didn’t think Kuwait or Iraq’s brutal leader were worth dying for.
    

             “There was one instance where Iraqi soldiers 
 that was circling over them,” McCausland says.
    

            A more recent example of an army losing the will to fight came in Afghanistan. 
    

            Amid the US military’s withdrawal from the country in 
, the Afghan National Army collapsed. They allowed the Taliban to quickly take control, even though the US had invested years and billions of dollars in training them. It was a low point for President Biden’s administration.
    

             The reason for the Afghan army’s complex surrender could be distilled in one question, McCausland says.
    

            “If you asked a Taliban soldier, ‘What the hell are you fighting for?’ he would say I’m fighting to free my country from the crusaders, just like my grandfather freed the country from the Soviets and my great-great grandfather freed the country from the British. And I’m fighting for my religion, my country and my home,” McCausland says.
    

             And if the same question was asked of an Afghan army soldier?
    

            “He would say I’m fighting for a paycheck—if the company commander doesn’t steal it.”
    

            The Taliban believed in their cause; the Afghan army didn’t, says McCausland.
    

            Every war has its defining images. The Ukraine war has already yielded some unforgettable ones showing the contrast in leadership styles of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.
    

            Recent photos of Putin typically show him attired in a suit, alone at the head of an 
 table, in a large, sterile room, with a general or bureaucrat cowering at the other end. The caption could well read: “paranoid and isolated dictator in action.”
    

            Contrast those images of Putin with those of Zelensky. One shows him standing resolute with his circle of advisers at night in Kyiv after vowing not to abandon the city even though he and his family were in danger. Other 
 show him in fatigues, buffed and bearded, swapping hugs with soldiers on the front lines.
    

            McCausland, who is also a national security consultant for CBS radio and television, says the images offer a lesson in leadership.
    

             “Just look at both photos in terms of who would you like to work for,” says McCausland, who offers leadership workshops to companies, non-profits and government institutions through his company,
 “I don’t care whether you’re in the military or you’re working for a corporation. It’s pretty easy to decide.”
    

             Armies lose the will to fight when they lose faith in their leaders, McCausland and others say.
    

             They say soldiers don’t expect generals or other leaders to hunker down in frontline trenches with them. But they want to know if their leaders care for them and respect their sacrifice.
    

             If you want to know how a leader can inspire an army to superhuman levels of endurance, consider this popular
 from one of the greatest commanders in history: Alexander the Great.
    

             Alexander was leading his parched army through an unforgiving desert in pursuit of an enemy when scouts returned to him with a scoop of precious water in a helmet. They handed him the helmet in front of his army.
    

              Alexander thanked the soldiers and then, in full view of his troops, poured the water on the ground. He announced he would not take any water unless all his men had the same. His troops cheered.
    

             Alexander the Great 
.
    

             “So extraordinary was the effect of this action that the water wasted by Alexander was as good as a drink for every man in the army,” one chronicler would 
later.
    

            We hear commentators warn about the dangers of hyper-polarization in American politics, the corrupting power of unregulated and virtually untraceable “dark money” and the breakdown of civic norms. 
    

            What many don’t say is that these trends can become a national security issue in times of war. Put simply, an army can quit when their country becomes too corrupt or divided to support them.
    

            A classic example is the mass collapse of the South Vietnamese Army in the spring of 1975.  The US military had been South Vietnam’s big brother and benefactor for a decade as both countries fought the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese army. 
    

            But the South Vietnamese government was 
. Its leaders and their cronies siphoned off military aid to enrich themselves, and never built popular support among the populace they purportedly served.  
    

            After the US military withdrew combat troops in 1973, the North Vietnamese army launched its final offensive on Saigon two years later. The South Vietnamese army refused to fight. News photos from that period show the army’s equipment littering roadways as soldiers abandoned their units and attempted to hide among the civilian population, says
 a historian at Middle Tennessee State University.
    

            “Once it looked like North was going to take over the South, there was nothing the South Vietnamese army could do about it,” Frisby says. “Once the Americans left, it [the loss of South Vietnam) seemed inevitable.” 
    

            Wars aren’t just fought by soldiers. They are fought by a country, and its people and its institutions. They are what historian 
 calls “social endeavors.” 
    

            The health of a country’s institutions -  its government, military and media outlets – matter just as much as a soldier’s will to fight, says Butler, author of 

    

            Butler pointed to 
 the pioneering work by the 19th century Prussian military strategist 
, who wrote that the “forces of passion” are every bit as critical to a successful war effort as the military and the government.”
    

            If a government is corrupt and does not have the trust of the people, its armies can lose the will to fight, Butler says. He says that appears to be taking place in Russia, where society has long been afflicted by a “societal malaise.” 
    

            Its citizens have experienced the traumatic breakup of the Soviet Union, rampant corruption, political apathy, and the crushing of independent media and dissenting voices, he says. Political apathy has grown.
    

            The malaise afflicting civic Russia may be spreading to its military, he says, adding that the signs are already there in the thousands of men fleeing Russia to escape conscription.
    

            “That’s pretty compelling evidence that that the forces of passion are not really effectively locked into this war,” says Butler, a political science professor at Clark University in Massachusetts. “It’s not surprising to see that playing out on the battlefield with troops who are deserting or disengaging.”
    

            The forces of passion now, though, seem to favor Ukraine. Its army’s men and women (women soldiers serve in combat units in the Ukrainian military) know what they’re fighting for.
    

             “Ukrainians are motivated by perhaps the strongest force a soldier can have – defense of their country, families and homes,” McCausland says. 
    

            The US military faced a crisis of morale half a century ago in Vietnam. 
    

            American troops never surrendered during the Vietnam War. They never lost a major battle during the war. The 1968 Tet Offensive, a failed campaign by North Vietnam’s army and the Viet Cong, was a 
 for the US.
    

            And yet it was also a devastating political loss. The American public turned against the war. Antiwar protests rocked the country. The American public grew enraged when they learned their country’s political and military leaders had 
to them about the purpose and success of the war. 
    

            Many American combat soldiers simply lost the will to fight. The US’ abrupt withdrawal from Vietnam was one of the most humiliating chapters in our history.
    

            The political context of the US’s war in Vietnam was different than the current war in Ukraine. In Russia, war protests have been crushed and the media has largely been uncritical of Putin’s conduct. 
    

            But on the battlefield, many Russian soldiers are discovering what some American soldiers realized in Vietnam — that they are fighting for a lie. 
    

            As John Kerry, a Vietnam combat veteran and future Senator who turned against the war, put it during a 
:
    

            “How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?’
    

            This is the question that may haunt Russian soldiers in Ukraine this winter. If Putin doesn’t give them an answer that makes their hardships worthwhile, the mass migration of men fleeing Russia after conscription may spread to the battlefield.
    

            And one frigid winter night, when the only sounds may not be of Christmas carols but of men dying on the battlefield, Russian soldiers may ask one another:
    

            How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?”

They need to win their final Group A match and hope PAOK beat  Russians Rubin Kazan
2010 winners Atletico Madrid clinch their place in the last 32 after a 1-0 victory at Celtic

            English Premier League form side Tottenham are on the brink of going out of the Europa League after Greek outfit PAOK Salonika claimed a shock 2-1 
 victory at White Hart Lane.
    

            Tottenham have been in superb form in recent weeks, winning nine of their last 10 league games to move up to third place in the table.
    

            However, their European form has not been as strong, and this month’s 1-0 reverse at Rubin Kazan was followed by another defeat on Wednesday to leave Harry Redknapp’s side needing PAOK to win their last game next month in order to help Tottenham achieve qualification through to the last 32.
    

            The visitors went ahead in the sixth minute when an unmarked Dimitris Salpingidis guided the ball home from Giorgos Georgiadis’ right-wing cross.
    

            And PAOK doubled their lead seven minutes later when Stefanos Athanasiadis tapped home from close range after more suspect Spurs marking.
    

            The home side pulled one back seven minutes before the break when Luka Modric scored from the penalty spot after Konstantinos Stafylidis was dismissed for handball on the line.
    

            However, despite having a numerical advantage for the whole of the second half, Tottenham failed to find the goal they needed.
    

            The result means PAOK are top on 11 points and have qualified for the last 32 knockout stage. Russian side Rubin Kazan are second on 10 points after thrashing Shamrock Rovers 4-1 in the other group game.
    

            For Spurs to qualify, they will now need to win heavily at Shamrock in their final match, and hope Rubin Kazan are beaten at PAOK in the other tie.
    

            Also through to the last 32 are 2010 winners Atletico Madrid, after the Spanish side won 1-0 at Celtic in 
 thanks to a superb long-range strike from Turkish international  Arda Turan on the half-hour mark.
    

            The other match between Rennes of France and Italians Udinese ended 0-0, a result that means Atletico have qualified with 10 points ahead of the final round of matches.
    

            Udinese are second on eight points and they will secure their place in the knockout round if they draw at home to Celtic in their final game, with the Scottish side needing a victory to progress.
    

            
 is the only group where both qualifiers have now been decided, after PSV Eindhoven won 3-0 at Legia Warsaw.
    

            That result means both sides have gone through, on 13 points and nine points respectively. Romanians Rapid Bucharest needed to beat Israeli side Hapoel Tel-Aviv at home to retain any hope, but they were beaten 3-1.   
    

            Another side to reach the knockout stage is Standard Liege, who saw off Germans Hannover 2-0 to make it three wins and two draws from their five 
matches so far.
    

            The Belgian outfit are on 11 points, three ahead of Hannover, who need a point from their final match against Vorskla Poltava to also secure qualification.
    

            Ukrainian side Metalist Kharkov continued their impressive run of form in the competition, thumping Austria Vienna 4-1 to secure their qualification from
 with 13 points from their five matches.
    

            Malmo and AZ Alkmaar drew 0-0 in the other match to leave Alkmaar needing to beat Kharkov in their final match to join their opponents in the last 32.
    

            However, there is all to play for in 
, with any two of three teams still able to qualify. Last year’s beaten finalists Sporting Braga beat Birmingham City 1-0, while a remarkable match in Slovenia saw Bruges of Belgium fight back from 3-0 down to win 4-3 in injury time against Maribor.
    

            That means Bruges and Braga are level on 10 points and they play each other in the final match. A draw there will see them both qualify with Birmingham, who are three points behind in third place, needing to beat Maribor in their final match and hoping the other game does not end in a draw.
    

            There was a suprise result in the 
quarterfinals, where Manchester United were beaten 2-1 at home by Championship side Crystal Palace in extra time.
    

            That result means Palace now play fellow-second tier side Cardiff City in the semifinals, while Premier League giants Liverpool and Manchester City face each other in the second semifinal.

 from detention in Russia ends a nine-month ordeal and allows her the chance to restart her stellar basketball career.
    

            Griner had a standout college career for the 
, where she broke numerous records, including the most blocks in a season in NCAA history with 223, her college’s first ever triple-double and the NCAA single-game blocks record with 14.
    

            Her NCAA career – which also included two first-team All-American picks and one second-team All-American pick – peaked in 2011/12 when she led the Lady Bears to the 
, men or women, and the NCAA title. Griner also won both the Wade Trophy for best women’s player on the collegiate level and the AP Player of the Year for the season.
    

            After leading Baylor to the Sweet 16 the following year, Griner was selected first by the Phoenix Mercury in the 2013 WNBA draft.
    

      
      

      

    

            She was named an All-Star in her rookie season, but missed the game due to injury. In total, Griner is an seven-time WNBA All-Star – only seven players in WNBA history have made more All-Star appearances. She was named an honorary All-Star at this year’s game.
    

            She has also won two WNBA scoring titles and been the league’s block leader eight times.
    

            Griner won her lone WNBA championship – and the franchise’s third – in her second season with the Mercury in 2014, as she continued to make history. The following season, in the opening game of the 2015 WNBA playoffs, she set the single-game 
 for blocks with 11 against the Tulsa Shock and currently holds the all-time WNBA record for made dunks with 23, per 
.
    

            The 6-foot-9-inch center has become known for her dunking ability, with only three other regular season dunks being recorded by the rest of the players in the WNBA’s 25-year history.
    

            The 32-year-old has also won gold twice for Team USA at the Summer Olympics and won another two gold medals with the US at the FIBA Women’s Basketball World Cup.
    

            She is unquestionably one of the US’ greatest ever players.
    

            So why was she in Russia?
    

            For many years, WNBA players have regularly gone overseas during the WNBA’s offseason to make the most of the higher salaries they can earn in international leagues.
    

            Griner has been doing so since the 2013/14 season, playing for Chinese side Zhejiang Golden Bulls until 2014 when she signed for Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg, returning each year to play.
    

            Under the WNBA’s current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), the average cash compensation for players is almost $130,000. For the top stars, the WNBA says they can earn “in excess of $500,000,” which is three times what they could earn under the previous CBA.
    

            “Other top players will have an opportunity to earn between $200,000 and $300,000,” a WNBA statement on the new CBA read.
    

            These salary increases were implemented partly to try and stop players traveling abroad, but these figures still pale in comparison to salaries in Russia.
    

            Top WNBA stars competing in the Russian Women’s Basketball Premier League – where there are no salary caps like there are in the WNBA – can often expect to earn more than $1 million per year.
    

            Last winter, Griner, reigning league MVP Jonquel Jones and Courtney Vandersloot of current WNBA champion Chicago Sky were among the players competing in leagues in Russia and Ukraine.
    

            According to the New York Times, nearly half of the WNBA’s 144 players traveled to play abroad during the last offseason.
    

            “Playing overseas has some positives, as the players are able to improve their style and can increase their individual technique,” Janeth Arcain, a retired WNBA player and current agent, told CNN in March.
    

            “But negatively, there is a factor that you will be tired for the new WNBA season and this can cause injuries and, maybe, you’ll be out of the season.
    

            “I don’t think the salaries of the WNBA are enough, so many players will play in other countries to be able to increase their income and be able to have and provide a better quality of life for her and her family members.”
    

            In the past, star names such as Diana Taurasi, Becky Hammon and Sue Bird have also played in Russia. In 2015, Taurasi opted not to play in the WNBA for a year after her Russian team, UMMC Ekaterinburg, offered to pay her more than her season’s WNBA salary.

The new 18-hole strokeplay tournament sees players split into two groups of four
McIlroy loses to Matt Kuchar while Woods suffers defeat at the hands of Charl Schwartzel
Woods and McIlroy to face each other on Wednesday when both might be eliminated

            It is not the scenario organizers of the World Golf Finals in Turkey envisaged. 
    

            Both world No.1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods could be eliminated before their much anticipated showdown in the strokeplay tournament on Wednesday afternoon after suffering defeats on day one.
    

            The high-profile pair are among eight of the world’s top players competing in the $5.2 million competition, designed to boost golf’s profile in the Antalya region of Turkey, where two players go head-to-head over 18 holes with the lowest overall score winning.
    

            But McIlroy lost by six shots to American Matt Kuchar, while a bogey on the final hole consigned Woods to defeat against 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel, from South Africa.
    

            
 

    

            Should McIlroy lose to Schwartzel and Woods be beaten by Kuchar in Wednesday’s morning matches, their clash in the afternoon would have nothing riding on it.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            McIlroy, who admitted he hadn’t played much golf since Europe’s miraculous comeback to win the Ryder Cup, had a disastrous run of holes to hand Kuchar the advantage.
    

            The two-time major winner dropped seven shots on the final four holes, and even the presence of his girlfriend, Danish tennis star Caroline Woznaicki, couldn’t arrest his slide.
    

            “I hit a drive into the trees on 15 and lost a bit of confidence,” McIlroy was quoted as telling reporters by AFP.
    

            “I need to win both of my matches tomorrow if I am to advance. I just struggled for a bit of motivation out there so I need to go out and concentrate on both of my matches tomorrow.”
    

            Kuchar, who took advantage of the relaxed dress code and sported a pair of shorts during his match, added: “I just thought I had to play mistake-free and hopefully Rory wouldn’t get  too hot.
    

            “There we are all square with four to go, he hits it right and makes triple bogey, and I go three up with three to go and I think both of us lost a little interest at that point.”
    

            Woods’ clash with Schwartzel was a closer affair as the players headed down the final hole on the same score, but the American sent his approach into a bunker to make bogey and hand the South African the win.
    

            “It came right down to the wire but I can’t believe how far that second shot flew into the back bunker and that was the match,” Woods said.
    

            “It means now that I have to play ‘Kooch’ (Kuchar) and try and win that match before facing Rory in the afternoon but my main concern is ‘Kooch’ and trying and beat him.
    

            “Despite the outcome I really enjoy the format and I haven’t played this format since the times of the Dunhill Cup.
    

            “It’s not something that we play very often and we saw today how it can swing on you. I had a three-shot swing go against me on nine and a two-shot in my favor at 17 when I birdied the hole and Charl bogeyed.”
    

            In the other group, world No. 4 Lee Westwood, from England, fought back on the final two holes to beat U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson by one shot, carding a round of 72 compared to the American’s 73.
    

            Westwood’s Ryder Cup teammate Justin Rose defeated American Hunter Mahan by four strokes in the other Group 1 clash with a round of 71 compared to Mahan’s 75.

            The injured second victim, a 33-year-old woman, was identified as a security guard at the hospital.

She is currently hospitalized and “her condition remains critical,” the prosecutor’s office added.

            The Henry Dunant Hospital is a geriatric hospital, located in an affluent neighborhood. It is run by the French Red Cross and it currently serves as a Covid-19 vaccination center.

Aiming to earn contract
Bolt is current 100 and 200 world record holder

            Usain Bolt had quite a day on Tuesday. The world’s fastest man celebrated his 32nd birthday and took part in his first training session with Australia’s A-League’s Central Coast Mariners. 
    

            “I’m not setting myself any targets as to ‘this is what I’m going to do,” Bolt told reporters.
    

            “I’m just going to put in the work. This is my first chance to get the chance to train and get to the level to play as a professional footballer. I’m here to learn and get better. I’m just here to make them proud and make me proud and do my best.”
    

            

    

            The eight-time Olympic gold medalist is embarking on a “indefinite training period” with the Central Coast Mariners, who play their season opener on October 21. 
    

            “It’s just like track and field – the first day of training is always the roughest one. It’s always going to take time, but I’m ready to work,” added Bolt.
    

            “I just want to get over the first hurdle and get a contract. I want to be treated as one of the boys and not as the the world’s fastest man. I want to be treated as a footballer as that is what I want to be.
    

            “This is just a moment for me to prove people wrong. I don’t care what people say. As long as I get my body in good shape I should be fine.”
    

            

    

            Bolt’s speed isn’t in question – his sprinting dominance was punctuated with a “triple double” as he clinched golds in the 100 and 200 meters in Beijing, London and Rio. But as to what will be his best position as a footballer, that’s yet to be worked out.
    

            ”I started out as a keeper in primary school, and the faster I got the further I moved up the field,” said Bolt. “I’m okay on the wing and I’m good at center forward.”
    

            The  A-League club’s decision to take a chance on Bolt has been labeled as a “gimmick” by some critics, but Mariners coach Mike Mulvey insisted it was an “innovative and creative” move.
    

            ”We are delighted that Usain has chosen our community to further his footballing career. The highlight is on the Central Coast, and that’s fine with me,” added Mulvey.
    

            

    

            Soon after retiring from athletics last year, Bolt trained with Borussia Dortmund in Germany, Mamelodi Sundowns FC in South Africa, and Norwegian club Strømsgodset and before joining the Mariners, he said he’d had been approached by a number of lower league European clubs.
    

            “We got offers from teams in Spain, France, places like that,” said the 32-year-old Jamaican. “For me it would have been harder, I would have to learn a new language.”
    

            The Mariners play in the Sydney suburb of Gosford to a capacity crowd of just over 20,000.

Nick Kyrgios wins title in Japan

            Andy Murray kept up his dogged pursuit of Novak Djokovic at the top of the world rankings by beating Grigor Dimitrov in the final of the China Open in Beijing Sunday.
    

            Victory at the ATP 500 event has seen the British star move a little closer to his Serbian rival and world number one, who did not defend his title in the Chinese capital due to an elbow injury.
    

            With a 500-point haul, Djokovic dropping the same number of points, Murray has moved to within 3695 points in his quest to end the season at the summit of the game.

            Djokovic will return to action at this week’s Shanghai Masters, where the title would ensure he will maintain his status at the end of year, but with plenty of points on offer in subsequent events in the Paris Masters and ATP World Tour Finals in London there is still much at stake.
    

            Scot Murray will go into Shanghai as the form player after not dropping a set on his way to his first China Open title and 15th-ranked Dimitrov, still seeking his first title since Queen’s in 2014, admitted as much.
    

            “Andy’s pretty much the greatest player this year. He’s been winning a lot and has a lot of confidence. He obviously knows how to move well on the court. All the credit to him,” he told the official ATP Tour website.

            Dimitrov, who secured a walkover victory over Milos Raonic in the semifinals, still provided a stiff test for Murray, the Wimbledon and Rio Olympics champion.
    

            But the Bulgarian could not recover from dropping his service in the opening game and eventually conceded the set on a single break.
    

            Murray moved a break ahead in the second set and served for the match only to be broken to love by Dimitrov’s inspired play.
    

      
      

      

    

            But he could not maintain the run and Murray ran out a 7-2 winner in the tiebreak to wrap up a 6-4 7-6 victory in just under two hours.
    

            It was his fifth title of the season and 40th of his career, the 16th man to reach that mark in the Open era.
    

            Earlier, Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland ended the hopes of Britain’s Johanna Konta, winning the WTA final at the same venue 6-4 6-2 for her 20th career crown.

 clinched a record-breaking 21st grand slam title after beating Daniil Medvedev 2-6 6-7 6-4 6-4 7-5 in an Australian Open final for the ages.
    

            The Spaniard surpassed the previous men’s record of 20 he held jointly with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, the latter of whom was denied entry into the country after having his visa revoked. 
    

            There had been major doubts about whether or not Nadal would even be fit enough to play at the Australian Open after missing the second half of 2021 with a foot injury.
    

            However, he returned to action at the Melbourne Summer Set tournament at the beginning of January, going on to 
 since May 2021.
    

            After beating Matteo Berrettini in the Australian Open semifinal, Nadal said he was just happy to be back on the court after being beset by injuries.
    

            As he sank to the floor, exhausted but victorious after five-and-a-half enthralling hours, Nadal proved he was not only fit enough to still compete at grand slams, but could realistically still win several more.
    

            “It has been one of the most emotional matches in my tennis career and to share the court with you [Medvedev] was an honor,” Nadal said in his on court interview. “I don’t even know what to say, guys, for me it’s just amazing. 
    

            “I can’t thank enough all the guys that are there [in my box], all the team, family … just how hard the last year and half has been and in the low moments you have been there to support me and without you guys none of this would be possible.
    

            “Being honest, one and a half months ago I didn’t know if I would be back on the tour playing tennis again and today I am here in front of you with the trophy again,” he said after Sunday’s final. “You don’t know how much I fought to be here. Thank you so much for the love and support.
    

            “Without a doubt [it was] one of the most emotional matches in my tennis career and having the huge support I received during the three weeks is going to stay in my heart for the rest of my life, so many, many thanks.
    

            “One month and half ago I would have said it would be my last Australian Open, but now I have a lot of energy to carry on. I cant explain the feelings I have now, but I’m going to try my best to come back next year.”
    

            

    

            The crowd was audibly in favor of Nadal when the two players walked out onto the court, with a smattering of boos echoing around Rod Laver arena when Medvedev was introduced.
    

            In Nadal’s second service game, the pair exchanged a grueling 26-shot rally which ended with Medvedev’s pinpoint backhand down the line to open up a 0-30 advantage.
    

            The Spaniard then shut the door with two quite remarkable points; the first a ridiculous passing shot after Medvedev had crushed a short forehand straight at him, the second a volley winner after being forced to go full stretch to reach a huge forehand.
    

            Nadal did eventually hold serve to take an early 2-1 lead, but he was being made to work brutally hard for every single point and was already being forced to produce some of his best tennis.
    

            As Medvedev cruised through his own service games by comparison, heaping the pressure immediately back onto Nadal, you had to wonder whether this level of tennis was sustainable for five sets for the 35-year-old.
    

            The pair had barely been playing for 20 minutes and already Nadal was drenched with sweat, his shirt clinging to his torso and beads falling from head. At the other end of the court, Medvedev looked like he’d barely broken a sweat.
    

            Indeed, Nadal’s serve was broken to love in his very next service game as Medvedev took a 3-2 lead. Things were looking ominous.
    

            Two more easy holds followed, as did another easy break of Nadal’s serve, as Medvedev closed out the first set without dropping another game.
    

            Nadal desperately needed to try something different in the second set; Medvedev was hitting the ball harder and more cleanly and felt like the favorite to win each point at the start of every rally.
    

            The Spaniard opened the second set with a relatively comfortable hold of serve – perhaps his only one of the match so far – celebrating with a shout of “si” and a fist pump towards his box as he attempted to fire himself up.
    

            It clearly worked as Nadal earned his first break of the match in Medevedev’s next service game – and he was really made to earn it.
    

            Nadal ended a mammoth 40-shot rally with a quite ridiculous sliced backhand that Medvedev couldn’t get anywhere near to open up a 15-40 lead, eventually breaking serve with his second break point to go 3-1 up.
    

            However, after an easy hold of serve, Medvedev held his own serve before breaking Nadal back – much to the despair of the boisterous crowd on Rod Laver.
    

            This match, though, was becoming unpredictable and Nadal broke Medvedev’s serve once again to take a 5-3 lead and give himself the chance to serve for the second set. 
    

            To make matters more complicated, an incident in the stands forced a number of security guards to come onto the court and stand around the two players as a man apparently attempted to jump onto the court.
    

            In keeping with the rest of the match, it was a brutal game that lasted more than 12 minutes and it was Medvedev that came out on top, finally breaking back with his fifth break point to make it 4-5 and deny Nadal the set.
    

            The pair exchanged holds of serve until the set reached a tie break. Nadal had done well to make this match a contest, but winning this set was felt crucial to ensuring the final would go the distance.
    

            The Spaniard has produced some Herculean efforts throughout his career, but coming from two sets down here was surely beyond him. Wasn’t it?
    

            As the clock ticked over the two hour mark, both players continued to produce outstanding tennis but it was once again Medvedev who got the better of Nadal.
    

            One crucial point in the tie breaker – with Nadal leading 5-4 – went to the Russian as Nadal’s volley dropped just wide. The hawkeye system confirmed the line judge’s call, but the decision was still roundly booed by the crowd.
    

            After Medvedev hit the backhand winner that earned him the tie break and deflated the crowd, he turned to look at the stands and raised his arms above his head as a mixture of cheers and jeers rained down.
    

            Despite the bitter disappointment, Nadal began the second set strongly and had a wonderful chance to give himself two early break point, but a less than perfect approach shot allowed Medvedev to hit a huge backhand winner that flashed past his opponent at the net.
    

            Nadal glanced up at his box with a worried look on his face, knowing how costly these squandered opportunities would be.
    

            The set – and the match – soon looked like it was over with Nadal 0-40 down while serving at 2-3.
    

            But the Mallorcan has forged a reputation as one of the biggest warriors on the court and, even now in twilight of his career, there are no signs of that fight fading.
    

            Nadal clawed his way back to deuce, before eventually winning the game to level the third set.
    

            The momentum of this final swung dramatically with Medvedev serving at 4-4, as nerves seemed to be getting the better of the Russian as he approached the finish line.
    

            One bizarre attempt at a drop shot resulted in the ball hitting the net and Medvedev sarcastically applauded the crowd, who he felt had made noise before he hit the shot, leading to a loud chorus of boos.
    

            Nadal broke his opponent with an incredible backhand passing shot down the line and the Rod Laver arena erupted – it was by some distance the loudest sound of the night.
    

            Unlike in the second set, Nadal held serve with ease thanks to four straight winners to make it 2-1 and Medvedev appeared to be rattled.
    

            During the changeover, he told the umpire that some fans were “idiots with empty brains” after one supporter had shouted just before Nadal was going to serve.
    

            The momentum continued to swing further in Nadal’s favor at the start of the fourth set, as the Spaniard somehow managed to save two break points to make it 1-1.
    

            Medvedev had certainly allowed to let the fans get inside his head, as a double fault to hand Nadal a break of serve ended with him sarcastically applauding and putting his thumb up to the crowd.
    

            The Russian calmed himself down during the change of ends and responded with an immediate break back, leading the area to burst into a chorus of “let’s go, Rafa, let’s go.”
    

            However, he just couldn’t stop a resurgent Nadal. 
    

            Medvedev managed to take his next service game to deuce after being 0-40 down, but Nadal was relentless in his pursuit of another break of serve and eventually got it at the seventh time of asking to end another marathon game.
    

            Nadal was now playing some of the best tennis of his life – and it had to be that good to beat his opponent – holding his next service game to take a 4-2 lead in the fourth.
    

            Medvedev had also called the trainer to massage his right thigh and at times he appeared to be in a little discomfort when moving that leg.
    

            Nadal’s next service game was the biggest of the set, as he rattled off four straight points from 15-40 down to make it 5-3.
    

            Medvedev managed to hold the next game, fending off a set point, but it was just delaying the inevitable as Nadal closed it out with a faultless service game. This match was quickly turning into one of the all-time great grand slam finals.
    

            Medvedev had to dig deep again at the beginning of the fifth set, saving another early break point. It was the 12th break point he’d saved in the match, a new record for the Russian.
    

            There was seemingly now no stopping Nadal, as he broke his opponent’s serve once again to take a 3-2 lead – perhaps for the first time he would allow himself to start thinking about number 21.
    

            Nadal ensured, for the time being, that Medvedev didn’t get back into the set, saving multiple break points in a game that went to deuce six times to make it 4-2.
    

            The match clock now showed these two show stoppers had been battling it out for five hours, yet neither player looked like dropping their level any time soon.
    

            Nadal was soon serving at 5-4 to win the championship and had a 30-0 lead, seemingly on the cusp of creating history. However, Medvedev dug deeper still to win four straight points and break back at the most vital of moments.
    

            However, Nadal was just not going to be denied his record title. He broke back immediately, perhaps playing his best tennis of the final, and then had his second chance at serving for the championship.
    

            It was a chance he wouldn’t squander again, holding his nerve expertly to etch his name into the history books.
    

            Given where he was just sixth months ago, at times pondering retirement, Nadal’s victory here in Melbourne will go down as one of tennis’ greatest wins.

Shkodran Mustafi heads in first goal
Sebastian Schweinsteiger scores late second

            With European soccer’s continental showpiece reeling from hooliganism outbreaks, Germany and Ukraine served up an entertaining game that was high on technical ability and no little drama on the pitch.
    

            The current world champions have won the European Championship three times – in 1972, 1980 and 1996 – and despite some indifferent form since its 2014 World Cup triumph, Joachim Low’s team served notice of the danger they will pose 
 with an impressive 2-0 win.
    

            Ten of Germany’s starting 11 players Sunday had been involved in its 2014 World Cup success and with Toni Kroos orchestrating the midfield, Low’s side went ahead after the German midfielder’s free kick was headed in by Shkodran Mustafi.
    

            Not that Ukraine didn’t trouble Germany – far from it.
    

            German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was frequently called into action and Jerome Boateng brilliantly cleared off the line in the first half.
    

            Even so Ukraine’s Andriy Pyatov was much the busier of the two keepers and Germany’s dominant performance was rewarded with a second goal in stoppage time, Bastian Schweinsteiger rounding off a rapid counterattack.
    

            After the game, Ukraine coach Mykhailo Fomenko described Germany as a “machine,” though ominously Kroos suggested there was more to come.
    

            “We are not yet at the level we want to achieve, but it’s quite a nice beginning,” said the Real Madrid midfielder after the game.
    

            The official slogan of 
 is Le Rendez-Vous with governing body UEFA hoping fans would “meet up and share the emotions of an elite-level tournament.” 
    

            Unfortunately some fans have had a different idea of rendezvousing since the tournament kicked off – literally – Friday.
    

            After trouble between England and Russian fans in Marseille, German and Ukrainian supporters clashed in Lille before Sunday’s game, according to the AFP news agency, while there was low level violence before Sunday’s Northern Ireland and Poland match in Nice.
    

            

    

            However, the atmosphere in the in the 50,000 capacity Stade Pierre Mauroy appeared to be good natured.
    

      
      

      

    

            Earlier two fans told CNN that supporting Ukraine and coming to France was a “chance to make memories in our personal lives.”
    

            Maxime and Nika Yelizarenko, who were born in Ukraine but now live in Canada, had traveled from Toronto, paying $4,700 for a three-week package.
    

            “Compared to watching ice hockey in Canada, that’s quite good value,” Maxime told CNN.
    
Nika and Maxime Yelizarenko, who were both born in 
, have travelled from Toronto to watch 
 
 

            Meanwhile Vadym Luikasyk and Natalie Kostiuchenko had journeyed from Kiev to Lille to watch their team play in a trip costing $3,000.
    

            “Ukraine is not so often part of the European Championship,” said Vadym, explaining why they had made the trek to France.
    
French authorities: 2 people injured in violence involving Germany & Ukraine fans in Lille. Major problem developing for UEFA now.

            They would have been buoyed by Ukraine’s start – Yevhen Konoplyanka testing Neuer – but gradually Germany asserted control.
    

            That dominance was rewarded when Mustafi powered in a header past Pyatov from Kroos’ free kick.
    

            Pyatov was soon in action again superbly blocking an effort from Sami Khedira after the Juventus midfielder was sent clear by a Kroos pass.
    

            

    

            In between the goal and Khedira’s effort, Yevhen Khacheridi did force a reflex one-handed save from Neuer.
    

            Boateng then athletically hacked the ball off the line after Konoplyanka threatened, while Andriy Yarmolenko had a goal ruled out for offside.
    

            As Ukraine grew in confidence, midfielder Serhiy Sydorchuk’s trickery in bamboozling a couple of German defenders had the team’s supporters purring in appreciation.
    

            

    

            After the restart Germany was quickly back in the groove and Pyatov had to punch away Julian Draxler’s shot, while a dipping effort from the imperious Kroos clipped the woodwork.
    

            Ukraine might have been on the back foot, but Yaroslav’s Rakiskiy’s low shot – saved by Neuer – demonstrated that Fomenko’s team were still very much in this game with German unable to extend its lead.
    

            If Berisha might wince when he watches replays of that opening goal, the Albania goalkeeper more than redeemed himself thereafter.
    

            Late on Mesut Ozil had a chance to add that second goal for Germany, but Pyatov again was Ukraine’s savior.
    

            In stoppage time Germany deservedly doubled their lead when Ozil crossed for substitute Schweinsteiger who sumptuously stroked the ball past Pyatov. 
    

            Germany’s win moved them top of Group C on goal difference ahead of Poland, who had earlier beaten Northern Ireland.
    

            

    

            Poland and Germany now play on Thursday June 16, while Ukraine faces Northern Ireland.

            As rumors circulate that some of the world’s top professional 
 would join the proposed Golf Super League, a handful have reiterated their commitment to the 
 and dealt the new venture a big blow. 
    

            Major winners Dustin Johnson and 
 – both heavily linked to the new, lucrative tour – both released statements on Sunday, stating their desire to remain on the PGA Tour. 
    

            And Rory McIlroy, when asked about the speculation as well as Johnson and DeChambeau’s statements, said he believes the Super League is “dead in the water.” 
    

            “Who’s left? Who’s left to go? I mean, there’s no one. It’s dead in the water in my opinion. I just can’t see any reason why anyone would go,” the 32-year-old said after his final round at the Genesis Invitational on Sunday.
    

            “No one really knew where Bryson stood. I was really glad to see DJ and Bryson put out those statements this week. We all want to play against the best players in the world and they’re certainly two of the best players in the world.”
    

            The Super League is reportedly a Saudi-backed proposed venture which is attempting to attract golfers away from golf’s main tours – the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour – with offers of big money.
    

            A few weeks ago, according to UK media reports, DeChambeau had been reportedly offered over $135.7 million (£100 million) to be the face of the new league – something he denied. 
    

            However, the 2020 US Open winner also denied he was looking to move away from the existing tours. 
    

            “While there has been a lot of speculation surrounding my support for another tour, I want to make it very clear that as long as the best players in the world are playing the PGA Tour, so will I,” DeChambeau 
 in a statement released on his Twitter. 
    

            “As of now, I am focused on getting myself healthy and competing again soon. I appreciate all the support.”
    

            The 37-year-old Johnson also rebuffed the rumors too. 
    

            “Over the past several months, there has been a great deal of speculation about an alternative tour; much of which seems to have included me and my future in professional golf,” Johnson 
 in a statement issued by the PGA Tour. 
    

            “I feel it is now time to put such speculation to rest. I am grateful for the opportunity to play on the best tour in the world and for all it has provided me and my family.
    

            “While there will always be areas where our tour can improve and evolve, I am thankful for our leadership and the many sponsors who make the PGA Tour golf’s premier tour.” 
    

            They now join a long list of names to deny any claims they’ll be joining another alternative golf league, including McIlroy, Jon Rahm, Tiger Woods, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth and Collin Morikawa. 
    

            One of the only players to openly show their support for the league is Phil Mickelson. 
    

            The six-time major winner 
 with Alan Shipnuck for his upcoming book, “Phil: The Rip-Roaring (and Unauthorized!) Biography of Golf’s Most Colorful Superstar,” said that he’d consider joining the proposed Super League because it is a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reshape how the PGA Tour operates.”
    

            

    

            “They’ve been able to get by with manipulative, coercive, strong-arm tactics because we, the players, had no recourse. As nice a guy as (PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan) comes across as, unless you have leverage, he won’t do what’s right. And the Saudi money has finally given us that leverage. I’m not sure I even want (the Super League) to succeed, but just the idea of it is allowing us to get things done with the (PGA) Tour.”
    

            However, McIlroy criticized Mickelson’s comments, calling them “naive, selfish, egotistical, ignorant.” 
    

            “It was just very surprising and disappointing, sad. I’m sure he’s sitting at home sort of rethinking his position and where he goes from here.”

Recuperating from serious injury
Says she wants to ski against men

            Lindsey Vonn’s need for speed never stops.
    

            In the skiing off-season, the American star has gone from 
 to testing her motor racing skills at a Formula One circuit as she recovers from knee surgery.
    

            The 2010 Olympic downhill champion drove two powerful Formula Renaults around the Red Bull Ring, which will host F1’s Austrian Grand Prix on July 3 and a MotoGP bike race in August.
    

            “It was unbelievable to drive a race car,” Vonn said of the experience. “I haven’t felt the speed since February, but that’s exactly what is so much fun.”
    

            The 31-year-old found there are several parallels between F1 and skiing. 
    

            “In both sports you need the right timing,” she explained. “When to speed up, when to hit the brakes and how to find the best line.”
    

            Vonn is still recovering from a fractured knee sustained in a crash in Andorra in February, which ruled her out of the World Cup season finale, but revealed her training workload has increased and she’s “fit, pain free and ready.”
    

            She plans to retire in 2019, when she aims to make a bit more history before she hangs up her skis. 
    

            It’s been 40 years since a woman competed in an F1 race, and in 2012 Vonn was denied her request to take on men on the slopes.
    

            However, she is still hoping to convince authorities to give her another chance. 
    

            “In 2019 I want to race with the men in Lake Louise,” she said. “Men will always be stronger than women, but if a woman is fit enough, she should at least get the opportunity to race men.”
    

            And has Vonn’s afternoon in a race car tempted her to swap two skis for four wheels once she quits?
    

            “I won’t stop the action after 2019. So you never know.”

            With a swish of his magic left boot, Lionel Messi broke yet another record as his stunning trademark free-kick sealed a comprehensive win against Sevilla.
    

            The strike was his 420th in La Liga, breaking Cristiano Ronaldo’s record of 419 goals scored in Europe’s ‘top five’ leagues – Spain, England, Germany, Italy and France.
    

            Despite finishing the match with just nine men on the pitch, Barcelona hammered Sevilla 4-0 to stay within two points of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga.
    

            The home side scored three goals in eight first-half minutes, the first an acrobatic effort from Luis Suarez, before Messi wrapped up the three points late on.
    

            Sunday’s four-goal haul took Barcelona’s total scored under coach Ernesto Valverde to more than 300, with Messi, unsurprisingly, leading the charts with 97.
    

            “I think the result at half-time was probably a bit misleading,” Valverde said after the match. “We were able to finish our chances, they weren’t. Before we scored the first goal, they caused us problems because they had men getting forward out wide.
    

            “Once we got the goal, I think that open game they wanted to play allowed us to create chances ourselves. Teams start pressuring you but you have to make it last 90 minutes.
    

            “As the first half went on, their legs got tired and that’s when you can find the space. The game opened up even more and we finished it off.”
    

            Real Madrid survived a second-half scare to beat Granada and retains its two-point cushion at the top of the table.
    

            Despite cruising 3-0 after an hour thanks to goals from Karim Benzema, Eden Hazard – his first in Real Madrid colors – and Luka Modric, Granada scored two goals in the space of eight minutes to set up a nervy finish.
    

            However, with the visitors pressing in search of an equalizer, Real hit Granada on the counter and secured the three points through James Rodriguez’s stoppage-time effort.
    

            “We want more, we are perfectionists,” coach Zinedine Zidane said after the match. “We want it, we need it and we will get it done. I am happy with what they are doing. There are no easy games and you must be on from the first minute. 
    

            “I think we can all be happy, because we are at the top of the table and it will be a long journey. We have hard work ahead. It is a shame that so many players are going to play for their countries but we must accept that they will not get to rest up.
    

            “We need to focus on the positives. We need to improve and that is what we will do. We are better than we were a month ago and we will improve because each player brings something to the team, and you can see that.”
    

            Sunday was billed as the first real Serie A examination of Antonio Conte’s new-look Inter Milan, as Juventus visited the San Siro to provide an early litmus test of the 
 title credentials.
    

            Having previously secured seven wins from its opening seven games, Inter was confident of claiming a first 
victory in more than three years.
    

            However, it took Juventus just four minutes to silence the San Siro crowd as Paulo Dybala struck a fizzing opener past Samir Handanovic into the far corner.
    

            

    

            

    

            Juve’s lead would last less than five minutes, as Matthijs de Ligt’s clumsy handball allowed Lautaro Martinez the chance to find the equalizer from the penalty spot.
    

            With the game petering out to a draw, Gonzalo Higuian came off the bench to give Juventus a crucial win with just 10 minutes remaining.
    

            “It was a match against a very, very strong team and I’m sorry about the loss,” Conte said after the game. “At the start of the second half, we didn’t do well but then we got back into the game and either side could have scored. 
    

            “There were chances at both ends but they scored, using everything in their arsenal and making their experience count. I don’t have anything to say to the guys because we still have a long way to go in terms of how we manage and understand moments in a match. 
    

            “Congratulations to them, we’ll roll up our sleeves and keep working hard to move forward on our journey. There are no shortcuts in this regard, they’re at a different level and we’re looking to improve so that we can close the gap.”
    

            Hoffenheim produced the shock of the Bundesliga season so far, beating Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena thanks to Sargis Adamyan’s brace on his first league start.
    

            With just one win to its name all season, Hoffenheim was a deserving winner against a Bayern side that had been the talk of Europa since its 7-2 hammering of Tottenham during the week.

British qualifier Dan Evans springs surprise by beating Bernard Tomic

            They are two titans of Flushing Meadows and on Thursday both Roger Federer and Serena Williams breezed into the third round of the U.S. Open.
    

            Federer, who won five straight titles in New York between 2004 and 2008, is only seeded seventh – his lowest mark since 2002 – but made light work of Carlos Berlocq.
    

            The 17-time major champion dispatched his Argentinean opponent 6-3 6-2 6-1 in just 95 minutes and remains on course for a first ever U.S. Open meeting with Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals.
    

            “I didn’t know Rafa was in my quarter – I’m kidding,” Federer said in an on court interview.
    

            

    

            “I am well aware of the draw, but at the moment I am clearly focusing on round by round and it would be a big mistake if I was thinking too much about  Rafa.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “I would love to be in that situation but for that to happen I have to keep playing well and keep winning.”
    

            Spain’s Nadal made light work of world No. 134 Rogerio Dutra Silva, beating the Brazilian 6-2 6-1 6-0.
    

            The second seed’s victory means he has extended his winning streak on hard courts to 17 matches.
    

            “I think I finished the match playing well, doing a few things well, moving better,” said the 2010 champion. “The important thing at the end is winning. The result says that I did the right things.”

            “I’m definitely used to it,” Williams said of her schedule. “I usually play every day. In regular tournaments I don’t have a day off. Only in the grand slams I get the luxury of having a day off. I guess I didn’t get that.
    

            “Definitely gives you more time to work on things you want to do in your next match, so that’s kind of more or less how I look at it, just as getting  more time to be more ready.”
    

            Williams also lent her support to Italy’s 
, the fourth seed, who made a tearful exit from the tournament after being beaten in straight sets by compatriot

            Errani said: “I’m feeling too much pressure. I don’t know why, but I’m not enjoying going on the courts, and that is the worst thing a player can have.”
    

            The 26-year-old was runner up at the French Open in 2012 and reached the semis in New York last year but Williams said the Italian shouldn’t be so hard on herself.
    

            “It’s hard but I think she’s doing a good job,” Williams said. “I mean, sometimes you have a tough day at the office, and it doesn’t mean that you didn’t handle the pressure well. I think she’s a good player.”

            For most, a dog is a man’s best friend. 
    

            But for select few, they’re also integral to a competitive sport – welcome to the world of sled dog racing.
    

            Debuting as a demonstration sport at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, 90 years later, the sport is still alive and barking as dogs pull their harnessed drivers, or mushers, around courses across the globe.
    

            Most popular in the Arctic regions of North America and Europe, any mention of sledding and the breeds of dogs involved – huskies, malamutes and similar Nordic breeds – always come with the association of snow. 
    

            Yet Matt Hodgson, Great Britain’s first world champion in purebred sled dog racing, is living proof that a relative lack of snow is no barrier to success when passion is involved.
    

            Based in the occasionally cold but rarely arctic southeast of England, Hodgson has developed his childhood fascination with dogs of the far north into Infury Dogs – a five-time medal winning sled dog team. 
    

            Hodgson cites Jack London’s 1903 novel 
 as one of his earliest influences, an interest that quickly turned to love with the arrival of his first dog, Ranger – an Alaskan Malamute puppy – in 2005.
    

            These days Hodgson runs with his pack of six “Deadly Sins” – all dogs taking their name from one of the seven biblical vices.
    

            It is an etymology that seems extremely harsh given their impeccable training and talent, not to mention their cuteness – compounded by the arrival of two adorable Greenland Dog pups, Nimis (gluttony) and Pride, in February last year. 
    

            Yet there is a method to the madness, Hodgson explains. Having intended to call his first sled dog – assumed to be female – Envy, Hodgson was forced to rethink when his Canadian Eskimo Dog was born male.
    

            Invidia, the Latin origin of ‘envy,’ was the replacement name of choice and subsequently set a trend, though Hodgson assures that “they’re my ‘deadly sins,’ rather than being deadly sins.”
    

            No rest for the wicked then, as training begins from puppyhood.
    

            “First of all, they’re my pets, so they’ve got to be good dogs all round,” Hodgson tells 
, with all dogs attending puppy classes to nurture good behavior and sociability, laying the groundwork for sledding further down the line.
    

            Training is gradually built up over a two-year period – after half a year, pups are allowed to run loose alongside the adults before being “hooked up” towards the ends of runs a few months later to get a feel for the harness. 
    

            A gradual build up is crucial and each dog varies, Hodgson says, but within a year dogs can begin club level competition. Between 15 and 18 months, the international level beckons. 
    

            Members of the public trekking through the forests of East Sussex at unsociable hours may be lucky enough to catch the Infury Dogs racing past on one of these sessions, with Hodgson having a permit to run on Forestry England land at certain times – typically at less busy periods – in order to fulfil his impressive five to six days of training per week.
    

            You may hear shouts of “Haw!” and “Gee!” as the dogs turn left and right, as Hodgson, with no reins or any physical connection to the pack, must rely on verbal commands alone, taught through constant reinforcement.
    

            If you’re very lucky, you may even catch Hodgson “wrapped around a tree” when the dogs catch sight of a streaking rabbit or deer. 
    

            “Most of the time, they listen,” Hodgson laughs. “That’s all part of the fact that you’re running with animals rather than a machine.”
    

            In competition, though, the Infury Dogs are very much machines. 
    

            Hodgson – who tends to compete in “short” races of up to eight kilometers (almost five miles), depending on terrain – has amassed five medals for Great Britain since his first international outing in 2015.
    

            His crowning moment came in 2019 when Infury’s relatively inexperienced team soared to victory at the UK’s maiden World Championships – becoming Team GB’s first ever world champion in purebred sled dog racing.
    

            Yet for Hodgson, self-proclaimed “consistently last” for his early international outings, winning has never been the absolute priority.
    

            Though disrupted by the pandemic – with a December trip to Belgium canceled following the Covid surge of the Omicron variant – the sport has taken Hodgson and his dogs around the world. 
    

            Travel restrictions willing, Sweden calls for the World Championships in March, with the tantalizing prospect of competing at the Östersund Ski Stadium in 
.
    

            “I love the dogs and the dogs take so much pleasure from it – if they didn’t enjoy it, they wouldn’t run and it wouldn’t be a lot of fun,” Hodgson said.
    

            “I like the camaraderie, I like the social elements, and I love sharing my love of dogs with people who also have a love of dogs, so it’s a coming together of different people. It’s nice to do well, but that’s not the main thing.”
    

            Now, 10 years shy of the 100th anniversary of sled dog racing at the Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport, talk continues to swirl of the sport one day making a return to the Games.
    

            Hodgson says the International Federation of Sled Dog Sports (IFSS) has been petitioning the International Olympic Committee (IOC), but he holds his own reservations on the suitability of the sport for Olympic status – fearing a “can of worms” opened up by logistics, finances and the very nature of the sport. 
    

            “Trying to take tons of dogs and travel from North America or somewhere around the world, it’s so expensive and there’s no money in it,” Hodgson said.
    

            “There’s so many distances, so many categories – which do you select? Is it going to be teams of huskies or teams of greyhound crosses? What distances are they going to run? Does it reflect the sport?”
    

            “Then there’s the issue of, ‘Is the Olympics about human sport? Is this actually human athletics?’” Hodgson adds, referencing the long-running “furor” around equestrian sports at the Games.
    

            Yet theoretically given the chance to compete in “his version” of the sport, Hodgson would “absolutely love” to represent GB at a Games.
    

            Until then, it’s racing through forests – and the occasional tree – in East Sussex for Hodgson and his “Deadly Sins.”

Riots broke out Sunday over the celebration of Nowruz
Erdogan blames the violence on the main Turkish political party

            Turkish government officials and security forces commanders gathered Thursday at a gendarme base to bid farewell to six police officers killed a day earlier in a gunbattle with Kurdish rebels in the restive eastern province of Sirnak.
    

            Meanwhile, the Firat News Agency, a pro-Kurdish website, claimed Turkish Cobra attack helicopters continued bombing the mountainous region Thursday where the deadly clash first erupted.
    

            The latest round of fighting in Sirnak coincides with flaring tensions between the Turkish state and activists from Turkey’s ethnic Kurdish minority.
    

            Riots erupted in a number of Turkish cities and towns Sunday after Kurds gathered to celebrate Nowruz, the Kurdish New Year.
    

            For years, the Turkish state banned Nowruz, and the holiday subsequently became the date of annual clashes between Kurds and security forces.
    

            In recent years, Nowruz celebrations were officially authorized and more peaceful.  The Turkish government had embarked on a so-called “democratic opening” which relaxed laws banning the Kurdish language and education.
    

            But this year, the Turkish government was widely criticized by local media when it refused Kurdish requests to mark the holiday on Sunday, and instead insisted on a weekday, March 21.
    

            Instead of celebrating the arrival of spring last Sunday, Kurds and police clashed in Istanbul and the southeastern predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir.
    

            Wednesday, a police officer died in the hospital of wounds received during similar riots in Sirnak province.
    

            Turkey’s prime minister placed blame squarely on politicians from the main Kurdish political party, the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP).
    

            “The BDP once more did what it does best… by turning our cities into a battlefield,” said Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in a speech before members of his political party Wednesday.  He accused the BDP of following orders of fighters from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.  Turkey, as well as the United States and the European Union, have formally labeled the PKK a terrorist organization.
    

            “The terrorist organization and the political party that is its extension resorted to ugly provocations,” Erdogan added. “The calls of the terrorist organization for months were about turning Nowruz into an uprising.”
    

            But Kurdish politicians said the Turkish government bore responsibility for the Nowruz clashes.
    

            “We have been doing these Nowruz celebrations for almost 12 years without incident,” responded Aysel Tugluk, a member of Turkey’s parliament from the BDP, in a phone interview with CNN.
    

            “The decision to ban (the celebration) came out.  This led to the people’s reaction,” Tugluk added.
    

            Fighters from the PKK have been waging a guerrilla war against the Turkish state since the early 1980’s.  More than 30,000 people, most of them ethnic Kurds, have been killed in the long-simmering conflict.  The Kurds are Turkey’s largest ethnic minority.  For decades, Kurds have been targeted by discriminatory state policies that banned Kurdish language and education.
    

            Over the past several years, Turkish security forces have rounded up thousands of Kurdish activists on terrorism charges. Scores of elected mayors and activists from the BDP party have been imprisoned on similar charges.
    

            “Policies of suppression, pressure and threat are being used,” said Tugluk.  “I hope the state rethinks its policies.  The current policies will lead to too much pain.”

            Those groups include the Kurdistan’s Workers Party, or PKK, which has been locked in a bloody battle with Ankara over greater Kurdish independence for several decades, as well as the Democratic Union Party or PYD and its militia, the YPG People’s Protection Units, offshoots of the PKK that have operated in Syria.
    

      
      

      

    

            Sweden denies sheltering people with links to such movements and has pointed out that the PKK is banned in many parts of the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, of which Sweden is a member.  
    

            The YPG, however, has enjoyed support from some Western nations for its role in helping to repel ISIS.
    

            Meanwhile, Finland, home to fewer refugees of Kurdish origin, has also voiced its own “tough-on-terrorism” stance.
    

            So far such pronouncements, furious diplomacy and backing from the White House haven’t been enough to break the deadlock and overcome Turkey’s objections.
    

            Delegations from Turkey, Finland and Sweden are meeting Monday at NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss Turkey’s concerns, a NATO official confirmed to CNN. 
    

            Speaking at a joint press conference last week, Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said Finland and Sweden were “taking all the issues very seriously and are having talks.” But, she added, “I also think that it’s also Turkey’s responsibility to try to find solutions at this stage.” 
    

            Bahir sought refuge in Gothenberg, Sweden’s second largest city, after fleeing war-torn Iraq in 2014. He joined a 100,000-strong Kurdish minority, which experts reckon now makes up almost 1% of the country’s population.
    

            Kurds do not have an official homeland: most live within countries in the Middle East including northern Iraq, eastern Turkey, western Iran and small portions of northern Syria and Armenia, and many of those who now live in Sweden have come from these places.
    

            “Erdogan is saying no matter where you are from, if you are a Kurd and you want freedom, you’re a terrorist. That’s not true,” Bahir’s friend Karim Haji Rasouli, originally from Iran, told CNN.
    

            Swedes were split on their country’s decision to join NATO ahead of the application, with polls indicating just over half of the population was in favor of the move. Similarly, many of Gothenburg’s Kurds are also skeptical.
    

            At an anti-NATO protest outside Gothenburg’s town hall, Iraq-born Fawzi Baban has come to meet his fellow Kurdish friends to express and voice his concerns about the path Sweden has chosen. 
    

            “NATO membership will lead us to more conflicts and maybe more wars,” he says. “As a Kurd I am more affected. Look at what some NATO members have done in my country. They completely destroyed it,” he adds, referring to the legacies of two Gulf Wars and the onslaught of ISIS thereafter.
    

            Meanwhile Hewa Cardoi, another Gothenburg resident with Kurdish roots, thinks NATO membership will help highlight the plight of his people and the discrimination they face in the countries of their birth.
    

            “Many NATO countries are democratic, with freedom of speech. We hope they won’t accept what Turkey is doing,” he told CNN.
    

            As Sweden’s NATO accession hangs in the balance, experts say Turkey is renewing its push for the extradition of dozens of Kurds it claims have affiliations to organizations it says threaten its security.
    

            Many of those Turkey is seeking to extradite are now Swedish citizens, and the subject is so sensitive that Stockholm has been loath to publicly discuss it, beyond saying it looks to have a deeper bilateral dialogue with Turkey on these issues.
    

            “Sweden’s government could have said no to Turkey straight away, but they didn’t,” said Baris Onay, a dissident who said he fled to Sweden after being imprisoned in Turkey for his socialist political views. “Instead, they go there to talk to him. The Kurds and other political asylum seekers, how are we supposed to think? Are they with us or with Erdogan?”
    

            Turkey, meanwhile, told CNN it would not discuss individual extradition cases with the media.
    

            “From the Turkish perspective they are saying: Look, Sweden, (if) you want to join a military alliance where we are one of the members then you have to respect our national security perspective,” said Paul Levin, director of Stockholm University’s Institute for Turkish Studies. “We perceive of these groups as national security threats. They (Turkey) make the same demands over other NATO member states but they don’t have the same leverage as they do now that Sweden is waiting to come in,” he said.
    

            “I frankly see rather limited ground for compromise,” Levin added.
    

            Lawmaker Amineh Kakabaveh, who is originally from Iran, is one of five Swedish parliamentarians reportedly on Turkey’s extradition list.
    

             “I’ve been on my guard for the last six to seven years,” Kakabaveh told CNN. “If people see that I, a Member of Parliament without roots in Turkey, can be threatened, it is a problem for freedom of expression in European countries, for migrants, for asylum seekers.
    

            “This is a threat against democracy. By not standing up for our rights, we contribute to other problems. Today it is Turkey’s demands, tomorrow it can be another country’s,” she said.
    

            She noted other prominent Kurdish figures on the list, such as 74-year-old writer and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Ragip Zarakolu.
    

            Zarakolu told CNN he knows what Turkish prisons are like, having first been incarcerated there in the 1970s and most recently in 2012 for publishing works in defense of minorities – like Kurds – before being invited to settle in Sweden.
    

            “Calling me a terrorist. It’s ridiculous. Here’s my weapon,” Zarakolu said, holding his pen aloft. “Does it shoot bullets?
    

            “Of course, Sweden is not going to extradite me,” he added. “But it’s harassment.”

Two Cristiano Ronaldo strikes give Real Madrid 4-0 victory over Osasuna
Bayern return to form in Germany with 5-2 victory over Werder Bremen
Monaco keep PSG title celebrations on ice

            Cristiano Ronaldo scored two stunning goals as Real Madrid closed the gap at the top of La Liga with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Osasuna at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.
    

            The Portuguese opened the scoring after six minutes with a 25-yard strike before adding a similarly spectacular second just after half-time.
    

            Headers from Sergio Ramos and Daniel Carvajal added gloss to the victory which moves Real into second place above Barcelona and three points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid.
    

            Atletico can stretch their lead at the top of the table back to six points if they win away to Valencia on Sunday while Barcelona can go above Carlo Ancelotti’s men themselves with victory at Villareal. 
    

            Both Atleti and Barca will have played a game more than Real by the time the weekend’s fixtures are complete, however.
    

            On the performance of his side and particularly Ronaldo who has suffered with injury in recent weeks, Real coach, Ancelotti, told reporters after the game that “everything went well for Cristiano and for all of the players. There were no problems and some have had a rest. 
    

            “The match was good, not high intensity, and Cristiano showed he is fine,” he added.
    

            Real are next in action on Tuesday as they look to protect their slender one goal lead over Bayern Munich in the second leg of the Champions League semifinal.
    

            

    

            The reigning German and European champions, Bayern, were in fine fettle themselves on Saturday as they bounced back from first-leg defeat against Real to record a comfortable 5-2 victory over Werder Bremen at the Allianz Arena.
    

            Franck Ribery, Claudio Pizarro (2), Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben scored the goals for Pep Guardiola’s men.
    

            Elsewhere in Germany, Borussia Dortmund ensured they would finish the Bundesliga season in second position after twice coming from behind to draw with fourth placed Bayer Leverkusen. 
    

            Goals from Lars Bender and Gonzalo Castro had twice given Champions League chasing Leverkusen the lead but Oliver Kirch and Marco Reus hit back for Dortmund both times.
    

            Leverkusen remain in fourth position, four points behind third-placed Schalke who play tomorrow against Borussia Monchengladbach, themselves chasing a Europa League place. 
    

            Fifth placed Wolfsburg missed the opportunity to leapfrog Leverkusen after they could only draw 2-2 at home to Freiburg.
    

            

    

            In Italy, Napoli drew 0-0 away to fifth-placed Inter Milan meaning one more victory will guarantee Rafa Benitez’s side a spot in next season’s Champions League qualifying stages.
    

            The Neapolitans currently sit in third place in the Serie A table, eight ahead of fourth-placed Fiorentina who earlier won 3-0 away to relegation threatened Bologna.
    

            Two goals from Juan Cuadrado and another from Josip Ilicic were enough for the Viola who now look likely to claim a Europa League place unless Napoli suffers a dramatic collapse.
    

            

    

            In France, meanwhile, two goals from Dimitar Berbatov helped second place Monaco to victory at AC Ajaccio, ensuring Paris Saint Germain will have to wait until at least tomorrow to claim the Ligue 1 title.
    

            The Bulgarian scored his seventh and eight goals for the club since signing on loan from Fulham in January as Claudio Ranieri’s men ran out comfortable 4-1 winners.
    

            With a seven-point lead atop the table and only four games remaining, PSG are unlikely to be denied a second successive league crown.
    

            In winning at Ajaccio, however, Monaco moved 11 points clear of third-placed Lille, all but confirming automatic qualification to the group stages of next seasons Champion’s League.

Williams will replace Azarenka as the new World No.1 Monday
Williams, 31, is the oldest women to hold top spot in the history of women's tennis
Azarenka has successfully defended both Australian Open and Qatar Open titles

            Victoria Azarenka might be giving up her spot as World No.1 but the Belarusian showed successor Serena Williams that she’s ready to fight to get it back.
    

            Azarenka avenged the loss of top spot to Williams by defeating the U.S. star 7-6 2-6 6-3 in the final of the Qatar Open in Doha Sunday.
    

            Williams, 31, will become the oldest woman to ever hold the No.1 ranking in the history of the game when she takes over Monday.
    

            But she failed to follow up her impressive semifinal win over Maria Sharapova following an error strewn performance.
    

            Instead, Azarenka, who successfully defended her Australian Open title last month, ended a nine-match losing streak against Williams to record just her second win in 13 attempts over her opponent.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            

    

            Leading 5-2 in the first set, the outgoing World No.1 allowed Williams back into the game with the American racing into a 6-5 lead.
    

            Williams had set point but failed to take advantage and Azarenka ensured her opponent paid the penalty by taking the opener on a tie-break.
    

            Williams hit back in the second, taking it 6-2, but she was unable to sustain her form and faltered in the third and decisive set.
    

            “I can’t say that I’m depressed like I am whenever I lose.,” Williams told reporters. “I’m definitely not happy, but I’m number one.”
    

            “It was such a long journey, and after winning Wimbledon and the US Open  and the (season-ending) Championships, I thought, I just don’t think I can win  anymore. I don’t know what it takes to be number one.
    

            “It was a good match overall. Victoria played really well, and did a great job.”
    

            

    

            Azarenka believes that her recovery from losing a one-sided second set was key to her success.
    

            She told reporters: “I just wanted to fight and give it my best, and give myself every  opportunity. 
    

             “I started at love-30 down and it was ‘you have to keep it together and pull it around’. Serena was on a roll.

 forces have withdrawn from 
, the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster, the state enterprise overseeing Ukraine’s nuclear power plants said on Thursday. 
    

            “It was confirmed that the occupiers, who seized the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and other facilities in the Exclusion Zone, marched in two columns towards the Ukrainian border with the Republic of Belarus,” said Energoatom in a statement published on Telegram. 
    

            On April 26, 1986, an explosion ripped through the No.4 reactor at Chernobyl, killing 30 people immediately. Countless others died from radiation symptoms in the years that followed.
    

            In late February, during the first week of the war, the plant and its surrounding territory fell into the hands of Russian troops.
    

            On Thursday Russian troops announced their intention to leave and hand over control to Ukrainian personnel, said Energoatom.
    

            It also posted the copy of a formal letter purportedly signed by a representative of Russia’s National Guard, a representative of Russia’s state nuclear energy company Rosatom and a Chernobyl plant shift manager, with the heading, “The act of acceptance and transfer of protection of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.” 
    

            The letter states that “the administration of the protected facility makes no claims in relation to the troops of the National Guard of the Russian Federation.”
    

            The Telegram statement from Energoatom said that a small number of “rashists” – a Ukrainian slur for Russians that combines the words “fascist” and “racist” – remained at the station.
    

            “It should be noted that the information about fortifications and trenches that the rashists built right in the Red Forest, the most polluted in the entire Exclusion Zone, was also confirmed,” Energoatom said. 
    

      
      

      

    

            “So it is not surprising that the occupiers received significant doses of radiation and panicked at the first sign of illness. And it manifested itself very quickly. As a result, almost a riot broke out among the military, and they began to gather from there,” continued the statement.
    

            CNN was not immediately able to verify those claims. 
    

            Separately, Energoatom said there were reports that a column of Russian soldiers who had encircled the town of Slavutych, which was built to house workers at Chernobyl, was also forming up to withdraw toward Belarus.
    

            The US is also seeing Russian forces “drawing down” from Chernobyl and from the north and northwest of Kyiv, a senior US defense official told reporters Thursday.
    

      
      

      

    

            The US believes Russian forces have likely “abandoned Hostomel airport,” also known as Antonov International Airport, northwest of Kyiv, the official said.
    

            The Russian occupation of Chernobyl triggered fears that safety standards inside the exclusion zone could be compromised.
    

            One week ago, Ukraine’s government said that Russian forces had looted and destroyed a lab close to the abandoned nuclear plant, which was used to monitor radioactive waste. 
    

            Russia has been targeting civilian infrastructure such as power stations during its invasion of Ukraine, according to Mason Clark, lead Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War.
    

            “This is coming through most clearly in Mariupol, where they’re very intentionally targeting water stations and power supplies and internet towers and cell phone towers and that sort of thing, and a very deliberate attempt to make it more difficult for the defenders to hold out and try and force them to capitulate,” Clark told CNN in mid-March.

            Spectators are not allowed into 
 National Golf Club due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 
    

            And while DeChambeau says he and his colleagues will miss having 
 “out rooting us on and cheering for us,” the big-hitting American is hoping that not having to worry about avoiding crowds will open up different areas of the famous course.  
    

            “As of this year, it’s going to be different because I’m going to be able to hit it on certain lines where patrons would be, and I feel like that it does provide me a little bit of an advantage in that case to be able to hit into those areas without thinking about it at all,” he told the media in a press conference.
    

            “You look at 18, I’m hopefully going to be able to hit it over those bunkers where the patrons would be. Another one would be 13 even. I can hit it through almost into 14 and they would be there, so this is a unique opportunity I think this year.”
    

            

    

            Over the last few months, no one has changed golf like DeChambeau has. 
    

            The addition of 40 pounds of muscle during lockdown enabled him to transform himself into the PGA Tour’s longest driver. And his new, big-hitting technique reaped immediate rewards after golf’s Covid-19 hiatus, including 10 top-10 finishes and his maiden major victory at the U.S. Open at Winged Foot in September. 
    

            DeChambeau has always been a fan of testing new technologies or methods to try and gain an edge, something that has previously annoyed some of golf’s more traditional members. 
    

            But following his dominant victory at the U.S. Open two months ago – he won by a six-shot margin – DeChambeau believes he is beginning to win people over.
    

            “I think people are starting to see that no matter what it is, whether I do this or that or face-on putting, it’s always to try to get better, no matter what I do. There’s going to be times of failure and there’s going to be times of success,” the 27-year-old said on Tuesday.
    

            “But I’m going to fail a lot more than I succeed, and I think people are starting to understand that it’s not just about me being quirky and doing things in my own way but it’s about the process of trying to be better each and every day.  
    

            “That’s what I hope people can understand, is that it’s not necessarily just about me being different or trying different things. It’s about me going through a process that will tell me if I’m doing the right thing or not. If I go down a road and it doesn’t work, I’ll pull myself back out and try something else.
    

            

    

            “I think that’s what hopefully can inspire a lot of people to say: ‘You know what, I’ve got to think about this hopefully in a new way and try and be as good as I possibly can, to do my best each and every day, and if something fails and something is wrong, I pull myself back out and I try something else that will make me better in whatever field it is.’”

            With less than a minute to go in the Mississippi Rebels and Tennessee Volunteers game Saturday night, fans threw trash onto the field following a defensive stop by the Rebels at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee. 
    

            Water bottles, pizza boxes, and beer cans littered the field, and a thrown golf ball hit Rebels coach Lane Kiffin.
    

            Southeastern Conference commissioner Greg Sankey called the fans’ action “unacceptable” and said the league “will review existing Conference policies and the Commissioner’s authority to impose penalties and communicate with the leadership at the University of Tennessee.”
    

            Kiffin, who was returning to Knoxville for the first time since 2009 when he coached the Volunteers to a 7-6 season, said after the game he felt a sense of relief.
    

            “They were just throwing stuff and I just said put your helmet on and let’s play. Actually there were people who came over that moved us off,” Kiffin said on the field. “They’re passionate fans, and there’s 100,000 people that came to see a show. It didn’t end up the way they wanted, so it is what it is.” 
    

            Kiffin’s father, Monte, had to be escorted from the field as well as the Rebels’ coach’s sister, Heidi, according to ESPN.
    

            “The Conference has established expectations for behavior and sportsmanship, and the actions of fans at Saturday night’s game were unacceptable under any circumstances,” said Sankey in a statement. “We are accustomed to intense competition every week, but under no circumstances is it acceptable to endanger the contest participants and disrupt a game.” 
    

            Tennessee Chancellor Donde Plowman condemned on Twitter the fans’ behavior.  
    

            “I am astonished and sickened by the behavior of some Vol fans at the end of tonight’s game,” 
 “Good sportsmanship must be part of who we are as Volunteers. Behavior that puts student-athletes, visitors and other fans at risk is not something we will tolerate.”
    

            She added she would personally apologize to Mississippi Chancellor Glenn Boyce for the fan’s actions.
    

            Danny White, Tennessee Vice Chancellor/Director of Athletics, echoed Plowman’s statement and apologized to the Mississippi football program.
    

            “Our Tennessee fanbase had much to be proud of through 59 minutes of football Saturday night — they created one of the best live sporting atmospheres I’ve ever experienced — but what transpired in the game’s final minute was unacceptable,” White said in a statement. 
    

            “Player and fan safety is paramount at all times. While I’m incredibly proud of our team’s effort on the field, I’m disappointed that their relentless performance was overshadowed in the game’s closing moments by the actions of several fans whose actions did not represent the Volunteer Spirit or the true character of our university.”
    

            As for the game, the No. 13 Rebels won 31-26 to improve to 5-1 overall, 2-1 in the SEC. The Volunteers dropped to 4-3 overall, 2-2 in conference play.

 President has apologized after the country’s interior minister mocked 
 newly elected leader and described her as a “sales girl.”
    

            The leader of Estonia’s populist far-right party EKRE, Mart Helme, questioned the ability of 
, 34, to run her country on Sunday. 
    

            “Now we see how one sales girl has become a Prime Minister and how some other street activists and non-educated people have also joined the cabinet,” Helme said on his party’s radio talk show Sunday, according to Estonian public broadcaster ERR. 
    

            Marin – who leads Finland’s Social Democratic party – has spoken about her life growing up in a disadvantaged family and working as a cashier, before she studied at university.
    

      
      

      

    

            She became the world’s youngest sitting Prime Minister earlier in December after replacing the nation’s former leader, Antti Rinne. Five of Finland’s major parties in parliament are all led by women, four of whom are in their 30s.
    

            “I’m extremely proud of Finland. Here a poor family’s child can educate themselves and achieve their goals in life. A cashier can become even a Prime Minister,” Marin tweeted.
    

            Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid apologized for Helme’s comments during a phone call with Finnish President Sauli Niinistö on Monday, according to a statement on the Finnish President’s website. 
    

            Helme on Monday justified his statement by saying: “That specific sentence about the Finnish Prime Minister, which you have interpreted as demeaning, I have actually interpreted as complimentary – as recognition that someone can work their way up from a low social standing to the peak of politics,” according to ERR.
    

      
      

      

    

            On Tuesday, Helme survived a vote of no-confidence in the Estonian parliament, which was called because of his comments. 
    

            It comes after the President of Estonia and its Prime Minister, Jüri Ratas, spoke on Sunday over the phone. According to Mailin Aasmäe, a press officer at the Estonian President’s office, the President “suggested that the minister of interior should be replaced.”
    

            The 
 is a largely ceremonial role with no executive powers.
    

            The Estonian interior ministry referred CNN to Helme’s party, EKRE. The party has not yet responded to CNN’s request for comment. 
    

            According to Reuters, Helme formerly worked as Estonia’s ambassador to Russia and is known for his outspoken comments.

            Boris Johnson might not be fully aware of it, but the next two weeks could contain two of the most significant moments in his premiership.
    

            As Brits wind down for the 
 and look forward to the 
 the country will live in real time the consequences of policy decisions Johnson has taken in the face of the two greatest post-war crises the UK has faced: coronavirus and 
  
    

            Both issues are politically hellish for Johnson. On Covid, his own Conservative party has vocally opposed his government’s approach for being too restrictive. This forced the Prime Minister to relax rules over the Christmas period, allowing families to meet for five days, despite the fact the UK appears to be heading towards a third spike. 
    

      
      

      

    

            On Brexit, hardline Euroskeptics have cranked the pressure up on Johnson not to sell them out at the last minute. This has forced the PM to create the impression that he is willing to take talks with the European Union right down to the wire, a strategy that means no one has a clue what happens at the end of the transition period on December 31.  
    

            Critics have accused Johnson of abdicating leadership and adopting vague positions on both in order to keep his party in line. And while this might seem a politically sensible bit of party management, the stakes are unbelievably high. Historians in years to come may view this period as the nadir of his leadership, depths from which he may struggle to recover.
    

            Earlier this week, Johnson found himself under fire after two bizarre performances in which he delivered confusing advice as to what people should do over the Christmas break. First, he accused Keir Starmer, who leads the opposition Labour Party of wanting to “cancel Christmas” unlike Johnson, who previously permitted three households to gather for a five-day period.  
    

            However, at a press conference later that day, he added a major caveat. Flanked by his scientific advisers, he said it was vital “everyone exercises the greatest possible personal responsibility,” advising that his rule of three households and five days “are maximums, not targets to aim for.” In his particularly Grinchy closing remarks, Johnson wished the nation a “merry little Christmas … And I’m afraid this year I do mean little.”  
    

            Reasonable people could be forgiven for feeling angry that, having being promised some brief joy at the end of a dreadful year, they were now being asked to make their own risk assessments, rather than being told what to do by the government.  
    

            And the danger is real. “Christmas has all the ingredients for super-spreading,” says Christina Pagel, director of the Clinical Operational Research Unit at University College London.  
    

            “Add to that the fact that schools are open and the virus is in schools. The only way it would be safe for kids to see grandparents would be if they and their families had at least 10 days to isolate (and preferably 14), which obviously there isn’t the time to do now,” she adds.  
    

            Johnson’s attempt to appease all sides of his party appears to have instead enraged everyone. “He needs to show stronger leadership to the country, and frankly to his parliamentary party too,” says a former senior Conservative adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “[The public] won’t forgive him when their grandparents are dead because the government wasn’t strong enough to recognize that ‘personal responsibility’ is not enough under circumstances like these.” 
    

            Unfortunately, the PM’s halfway house went down no better with those who think people should be left to decide for themselves what’s best to do. Many of his MPs are very unhappy that Johnson offered the public a glimmer of hope to make their own decisions, only to then offer a finger-wagging series of warnings ahead of the Christmas break.  
    

            Asked to comment on criticism that the PM had failed to give leadership on both Christmas meetings and Brexit, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “As the PM has said, banning Christmas would be inhuman and we do not want to criminalize plans people have made for some time. We want to balance pragmatism with the overriding priority of protecting public health.”
    

            They added: “The safest way to spend Christmas is with your own household or support bubble in your own home – and we strongly recommend this is what you do if possible.”
    

            The impact of Christmas gatherings will be unclear for a few weeks, unlike Johnson’s other big headache: Brexit.  
    

            The fact that negotiations have gone on so late means that even if a deal is reached in the coming days, businesses have next to no time to implement new measures if they are to carry on trading with the EU. And the secretive nature of the negotiations has meant that traders have been driving towards a metaphorical cliff edge with their headlights off.  
    

            “It’s very hard to predict what is going to happen on the ground and that is what companies are most worried about. You can have something on paper in a deal but the situation on the ground could be very different from country-to-country,” says Allie Rennison, head of EU and trade policy at the Institute of Directors. “We needed plans in place so that whatever happens, there was a good period of time for business to understand whatever had been agreed, but there are now impossible time constraints on that,” she adds. 
    

            If the situation on the ground is chaotic, with lorries stuck at borders, goods not flowing, shortages of foods and medicines, or any other major disruption, Johnson is in serious trouble.  
    

            “It’s true that taking the EU to the wire was a necessity for Johnson. It both proved to his party he was serious about negotiating hard and probably helped get a better deal out of the EU,” says Tim Montgomerie, who served as an adviser to Johnson until 2019. “However, there isn’t much time and that, for businesses, is ridiculous. All the game-playing should have come ahead of when he first said he was going to walk away in October.” 
    

            Given that Johnson’s Conservatives have traditionally been the party of business, this could be politically catastrophic in the long run. “For some companies, disruption is deadly as you can lose customers quickly. If a supermarket chain suddenly decides it’s too much hassle to deal with British companies and can source things more easily elsewhere, they might never get that customer back,” says Rennison.  
    

            Johnson might not know it, but his attempts to navigate a narrow political path could backfire spectacularly.  
    

            “For someone who professes to take such a great interest in history, he doesn’t seem right now to be thinking beyond the coming weeks and how it might reflect on him,” says Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University London.  
    

      
      

      

    

            “It’s clear that his government’s mixed message on Christmas is going to cost lives and it’s possible that has been baked in: when 65,000 people have already died, what’s another few thousand? But my goodness it’s a risk,” Bale adds. 
    

            “On Brexit, once businesses know what is going on it will be fine. But if it goes wrong, people will remember those weeks where things were awful because no one had enough time to prepare.” 
    

            Johnson’s had a torrid time since entering Downing Street. Amazingly, he’s thus far not been affected too badly in opinion polls. 
    

            However, there are four years left for the consequences of his actions, inactions and poor party management to catch up with him before the next scheduled general election. And if both Christmas and Brexit are catastrophic disasters, there is a good chance his party might decide Johnson isn’t the man they want to fight that vote in 2024.

            German police and prosecutors are questioning a nurse accused of poisoning five premature babies with morphine at a hospital. 
    

            Five premature babies at the University Hospital of Ulm in southern Germany between the ages of one day and one month suddenly began experiencing life-threatening breathing difficulties on the morning of December 20 last year, authorities said in a statement. 
    

            The suspect was on duty at the hospital that morning and was taken into custody on Wednesday. The nurse is being investigated for five counts of attempted manslaughter and grievous bodily harm. All the babies survived and police said they were not expecting further health problems. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Police searched staff members’ lockers at the hospital and authorities confirmed Thursday at a press conference that they found a syringe containing breast milk among the nurse’s possessions. Police and the public prosecutor confirmed that forensic testing showed the syringe had been laced with morphine. 
    

            Christof Lehr, Ulm’s chief public prosecutor, said that the nurse denies having given the babies morphine.
    

            “In the early morning hours of December 20, 2019, five premature babies housed in a room in the Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine in Ulm almost simultaneously suffered from life-threatening breathing problems, which fortunately, thanks to the immediate intervention of the hospital staff, remained without consequences according to current medical assessments,” investigating authorities said in a statement. 
    

            Hospital authorities first suspected an infection, but urine tests disproved that theory, while at the same time revealing traces of morphine in all five infants – even though two had not been prescribed the drug.
    

            Morphine is routinely stocked at neonatal departments to treat the withdrawal symptoms of babies born to mothers who are addicted.

            The NFL plans to have the song “Lift Every Voice and Sing” – known as the Black national anthem – performed live or played before every game in Week 1 of the NFL season, a source familiar with the league’s discussions told CNN on Thursday. 
    

            The news was first reported by 
, which is owned by ESPN.
    

            According to the source, “Lift Every Voice and Sing” will be played before “The Star-Spangled Banner.” This will begin with the nationally televised first game of the season, which is on September 10, when the defending Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs, host the Houston Texans.
    

            The song also will be played during the full slate of those Week 1 Sunday afternoon games, during Sunday Night Football and during the two ESPN Monday night games, the source says.
    

            Additionally, the source says that the league is working collaboratively with players to recognize victims of systemic racism throughout the season. Among the items being discussed with players are adding names of victims on helmet decals or jerseys patches, as well as educational programs and storytelling (such as additional PSAs about the victims and their families).
    

            “Lift Every Voice and Sing” was first written as a poem by James Weldon Johnson, according to the NAACP’s 
. Johnson’s brother John Rosamond Johnson set the poem to music in 1899. It was first performed in 1900 by a choir at the segregated Stanton School in Jacksonville, Florida – where James Weldon Johnson was principal – as part of a celebration of former President Abraham Lincoln’s birthday.

            Negotiations are  on-going to arrange a two-on-two spectacle which would see Mickelson team up with 
to take on Woods and Manning, a source familiar to the negotiations confirmed to CNN Sport. 
    

            Professional golf is on hold because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, but Mickelson had hinted on social media that he was “working on” plans for a clash between the two golfing greats.
    

            With the date and time of the match still far from finalized, other details of the negotiations are more clear. 
    

            The event is being organized jointly by the PGA Tour and WarnerMedia (the parent company of CNN) and it is not expected to air on pay-per-view. 
    

            The setting for the match is also yet to be confirmed, but there would be no spectators present and only a small television production team, with all individuals adhering to recommended social distancing guidelines. 
    

            CNN has reached out to the four athletes for comment. The PGA Tour declined to comment. 
    

            

    

            Should it go-ahead, the charity event would be a rematch of the
 between Woods and Mickelson. 
    

            Dubbed “The Match,” the pair met in a $9 million made-for-TV showdown which Mickelson won after 22 holes at Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas.
    

            Mickelson also won $600,000 in charity side bets, as he was closest to the pin on three of the par 3s. But he missed a birdie putt on the first hole and donated $200,000 to Woods’ handpicked charity.
    

            Woods and Mickelson have 20 majors between them and were fierce rivals at the height of their careers, but the veteran golfers have become friendly in recent years.
    

            Similarly, Brady and the retired Manning enjoyed a healthy rivalry during their respective playing careers.
    

            Brady has recently joined the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after spending his entire NFL career – 20 seasons – with the New England Patriots, winning six of the nine Super Bowls he reached.

2018-06-27 12:41:00+00:00,,"""World-first"" autonomous bus operating on streets of small Swiss town
""Trapizio"" is the only self-driving bus to be integrated with other public transport

            Should you find yourself walking through the quiet cobbled streets of Neuhausen Rheinfall, you might just stumble across the future of public transportation. 
    

            That’s because this year the small Swiss town has embraced an all-electric self-driving bus that’s the first of its kind anywhere in the world. 
    

            While other manufacturers have introduced autonomous buses elsewhere to various degrees of success – from the 
o 
 that crashed on its first day –  never before has one been fully integrated into a regular timetable. 
    

            Open to the general public since March 2018, passengers can now travel to the nearby Rhine Falls, the largest waterfall in Europe visited by an estimated 1.5 million tourists a year, without a driver in sight. 
    

            “It’s an all-autonomous bus and it’s fully embedded into our public transport system here in Schaffhausen,” Trapeze CEO Peter Schneck told 
. “It allows us to drive without a driver.” 
    

            

    

            

    

            Negotiating the roads alongside regular traffic, the “Trapizio” also has no need for pedals or a steering wheel, instead relying on a number of advanced sensors to identify potential hazards. 
    

            Should the bus approach an unexpected obstacle or unwitting pedestrian during its pre-programmed route, its response time is quicker than that of a human being. 
    

            Its top speeds aren’t yet something to write home about – limited for the time being to 25 kph – but the Trapizio does boast some pretty impressive charging times.
    

            Able to operate throughout the day on a single battery, the bus is typically charged overnight in a process that takes between three to four hours.  
    

            It certainly looks the part, but is it safe? 
    

            “Absolutely,” enthuses Schneck, who says he’s tested that claim himself on numerous occasions. “It will stop immediately, faster than a car.”  
    

            

    

            

    

            For now, a supervisor stands by and can take control of the bus when required with a “gamepad,” but the hope is that in time outside assistance won’t be necessary as the technology becomes more widely accepted. 
    

            “This marks the kick-off of our journey towards Stage 5 of autonomous mobility, when ultimately no person will be needed for attendance on board anymore,” said Schneck. 
    

            Not that he believes this innovative design will lead to 
 buses becoming driverless any time soon. 
    

            “Our intention is to strengthen public transport,” Schneck explains. “One of the reasons why people are using their individual car is because there are some fractures in mobility.
    

            “So when you want to go to your final destination, typically you have to walk from home to the bus stop.
    

            “If it’s raining, you might still use your car, and once you’re in the car you go ahead. But if someone picks you up at home for the first mile, then brings you to the hub for a bus or tram, then you can continue your journey to your final destination.”
    

            One potential benefit of directly linking autonomous mobility with traditional public transport services is the capability to explore new routes. 
    

            “[We] consider autonomous vehicles to be more than just a test object,” said Bruno Schwager, director of the public transport authority of Schaffhausen. 
    

            “In the future, self-driving vehicles are expected to allow routes that to date have never been covered or were unprofitable to now be operated at reasonable cost. This benefits all public transport activities.
    

            

    

            “Autonomous vehicles are an ideal supplement to existing services and do not jeopardise any jobs – quite the opposite is true, for they may even create new ones.”
    

            And it could be just the beginning. 
    

            

    

            The aim, the manufacturers say, is to not only establish a self-driving shuttle bus on the streets of Schaffhausen, but to design the future of mobility worldwide.

            Just two days before the 
, soccer’s world governing body FIFA confirmed that no alcohol will be sold at the eight stadiums which will host the tournament’s 64 matches.
    

            “Following discussions between host country authorities and FIFA, a decision has been made to focus the sale of alcoholic beverages on the FIFA Fan Festival, other fan destinations and licensed venues, removing sales points of beer from Qatar’s FIFA World Cup 2022 stadium perimeter,” said the FIFA statement.
    

            The Muslim country is considered to be very conservative and tightly regulates alcohol sales and usage.
    

            In September, Qatar had said it would permit ticketed fans to buy alcoholic beer at World Cup soccer matches starting three hours before kickoff and for one hour after the final whistle, but not during the match.
    

            “There is no impact to the sale of Bud Zero which will remain available at all Qatar’s World Cup stadiums,” added the FIFA statement.
    

      
      

      

    

            “Host country authorities and FIFA will continue to ensure that the stadiums and surrounding areas provide an enjoyable, respectful and pleasant experience for all fans.”
    

            While some fans may be pleased the stadiums are alcohol free, others are confused and frustrated – including 21-year-old student Arnov Paul-Choudhury.
    

            “It’s the World Cup, it’s football, you need to be able to drink around the stadium,” he told CNN Sport in Doha. “I just don’t think they’re doing the right things to attract fans.”
    

            Budweiser was set to sell beer within the ticketed perimeter surrounding each of the eight stadiums before and after each game.
    

            The beer brand, which is one of FIFA’s partners, tweeted, “Well, this is awkward,” though the social media post was quickly deleted.
    

            Budweiser is owned by the world’s largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev.
    

            “The tournament organisers appreciate AB InBev’s understanding and continuous support to our joint commitment to cater for everyone during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022,” continued the FIFA statement.
    

      
      

      

    

            Budweiser pays around $75 million for its sponsorship agreement with FIFA, according to the New York Times.
    

            “As partners of FIFA for over three decades, we look forward to our activations of FIFA World Cup™ campaigns around the world to celebrate football with our consumers,” said an AB InBev spokesperson.
    

            “Some of the planned stadium activations cannot move forward due to circumstances beyond our control.” 
    

            The Football Supporters’ Association (FSA), the national representative body for football fans in England and Wales, has condemned the decision on beer sales.
    

            In a statement released on Friday, the FSA said: “Some fans like a beer at the match, and some don’t, but the real issue is the last minute U-turn which is speaks to a wider problem – the total lack of communications and clarity from the organising committee towards the supporters.
    

            “If they can change their minds on this at a moment’s notice, with no explanation, supporters will have understandable concerns about whether they will fulfill other promises relating to accommodation, transport or cultural issues.”
    

            Fans will not be the only ones disappointed with the eleventh-hour U-turn. 
    

            Ben Peppi, head of sports services at JMW Solicitors, says the move is “hugely damaging” for FIFA’s brand.
    

            “Brands will be treading very carefully now around FIFA for future tournaments,” he told CNN Sport. “Because if two days out before the biggest global sporting event that they host, they turn round to a brand and say, ‘you can’t do this and you can’t do that’ and breach that contract, that’s not going to give any security to any new brand.” 
    

            The 2022 
 runs from November 20 until December 18.

            A war in Europe was unimaginable two weeks ago. There’s been widespread shock around the world over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s merciless and unprovoked attack on Ukraine, and among many 
.
    

            It is at times like these that we look to our own leaders to express how we feel and to respond accordingly. Britain’s Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has risen to the occasion enough for many to forget – for now at least – about lockdown parties that led to calls for his resignation.
    

            The Queen has been lying low at Windsor Castle as she continues to recover from Covid. She has been well enough to do paperwork and host virtual audiences but little else (more on that later). We learned on Thursday, though, that she was so moved by events in Ukraine she had privately made 
 to the humanitarian appeal from the Disasters Emergency Committee – a group of 15 leading UK aid charities. Buckingham Palace confirmed the Queen’s donation but would not comment further, telling us it was a “private matter.”
    

            Other members of her family have stepped up in her absence, as is the form these days.
    

            The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said in a tweet over the weekend that they “stand with the President and all of Ukraine’s people as they bravely fight for that future.”
    
In October 2020 we had the privilege to meet President Zelenskyy and the First Lady to learn of their hope and optimism for Ukraine’s future. 
Today we stand with the President and all of Ukraine’s people as they bravely fight for that future 🇺🇦 W & C

            Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelensky, tweeted back, saying he and wife Olena were grateful to the couple that “at this crucial time, when Ukraine is courageously opposing Russia’s invasion, they stand by our country and support our brave citizens.”
    
Olena and I are grateful to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge 
 that at this crucial time, when Ukraine is courageously opposing Russia's invasion, they stand by our country and support our brave citizens.  Good will triumph.

            From California, on the day Russia launched its invasion, Prince Harry and Meghan expressed their solidarity with the people of Ukraine “against this breach of international and humanitarian law” and urged “the global community and its leaders to do the same.”
    

            On Tuesday, Prince Charles went further, speaking of “democracy” and “an open society” coming under attack in Ukraine “in the most unconscionable way.” He went on: “We are in solidarity with all those who are resisting brutal aggression.”
    

            If the UK were ever to try to rebuild bridges with Putin, these comments will hang over Charles. That’s why, as a rule, royals don’t cast judgment on foreign heads of state. They’re in it for life, unlike transient politicians. Putin, however, has crossed the line on this one for Charles, as he has for most of the Western world.
    

            But it was perhaps his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, who best expressed the nation’s shock without words, during the couple’s visit to a Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral in London on Wednesday.
    

            The pair went to the Cathedral of the Holy Family – which has become a rallying point for the British Ukrainian community – where they met the Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, and his wife, Inna Prystaiko, as well as Bishop Kenneth Nowakowski. 
    

            On arrival, the royals met children from an associated Ukrainian school and received a traditional offering of bread and salt. The couple also lit a candle and laid sunflowers, Ukraine’s national flower, at the altar.
    

            Addressing members of the Ukrainian community working to support relief efforts, Charles praised the group for their courage in the face of wanton aggression. He said: “My wife and I have been deeply moved by everything we’ve heard today during our visit and, above all, by the extraordinary bravery, generosity and fortitude of the Ukrainian community in the face of such truly terrible aggression. So, if I may say so, our thoughts and prayers, however inadequate they may be, are with all of you at this most critical time.”
    

            During the visit, a camera picked up tears in Camilla’s eyes and a journalist from the Royal Rota covering the event reported the duchess “wept frequently during the engagement and comforted the ambassador’s wife, who was also crying.” 
    

            The Queen seems to be on the mend after contracting coronavirus nearly two weeks ago, undertaking a number of video calls this week.
    

            On Thursday, she held two virtual audiences from Windsor with the new ambassadors for Trinidad and Tobago and Malawi. Earlier this week, she also welcomed incoming envoys to the UK from Andorra and Chad in video meetings.
    

            The palace has been reluctant to give a daily health update but clearly the monarch is feeling well enough to return to virtual engagements. It is understood she will continue with other duties and has some private engagements in her diary.
    

            One event that was taken off the books was a diplomatic reception that was due to take place at Windsor Castle on Wednesday. Buckingham Palace said over the weekend the Queen had “accepted the Foreign Secretary’s advice” to postpone the event. Rather than being related to her health, it’s likely UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss made the suggestion in the light of the ongoing crisis facing Ukraine.
    

            The next major events the Queen is hoping to attend are the annual Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on March 14 and a service of thanksgiving for her late husband, Prince Philip, at the same venue on March 29.

            The Prince of Wales brought together some of the most influential Black Britons when he hosted a reception for supporters of the Powerlist at Clarence House on Tuesday. The Powerlist is an annual celebration of 100 of the most influential people of African, African-Caribbean and African-American heritage. “These communities have made and continue to make an incredibly positive difference to society as a whole and, in doing so, have built a real community spirit and cohesion,” Charles said. The heir to the throne added it was “particularly pleasing to see the diversity of talent” recognized by the initiative, from the arts to business, the environment and technology, among other sectors. Charles said the Powerlist – now in its 16th year – has helped identify “expertise and leadership” that will aid the UK in meeting the challenges it continues to face across society.

The trip was focused on the importance of the agricultural industry, with their engagements centered around how community groups are supporting young people, while also celebrating the region’s history. In Abergavenny, they stopped at a goat farm that has supplied milk to local cheesemakers for almost two decades. Meanwhile, in Blaenavon, the pair rolled up their sleeves in the kitchen of a local youth center, where they baked Welsh cakes before playing a game of pool.

Meghan spoke to Anita Hill, an American lawyer who became a household name in 1991 when she testified about sexual harassment she allegedly endured from then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, for URL Media. Reflecting on Jackson’s nomination, Hill wrote in an op-ed that she wanted to seek the thoughts of others who had “entered arenas once thought to be inaccessible,” so she reached out to Meghan. The duchess praised President Joe Biden’s pick, telling her “the civil rights history of tomorrow is being written today.” Meghan added that Jackson’s nomination “opened new ground for women’s representation at the highest level of a judicial system that for too long has tilted against the very community she hails from.” 

    

            

    

            An exhibition opening Friday at London’s Kensington Palace will debut a portrait of Princess Diana that’s never been seen by the public. Taken by fashion photographer David Bailey in 1988, the image was originally commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery but has remained in Bailey’s archive until now. The black-and-white image shows an elegant 27-year-old Diana gazing into the distance, wearing a satin off-the-shoulder gown and a pair of teardrop earrings.
    

            Bailey, who has photographed multiple cultural legends, including Andy Warhol, Twiggy and the Beatles, was selected by Diana for his high-contrast lighting and minimalist style. Her choice “reflected her desire to establish a new photographic identity for herself,” distinct from the more established forms of royal portraiture, according to a news release from Historic Royal Palaces, the British charity tasked with running six of the UK’s palaces. Revealed now after 34 years, the image further solidifies her public reputation as one of the most fashion-forward members of the British royal family. 

    

            In addition to the Diana portrait, the exhibition, titled “A Life Through A Royal Lens,” will showcase a range of works exploring the relationship between photography and the monarchy.
    

            It includes photos snapped on royal tours and portraits of heads of state, as well as off-duty moments away from the public eye. Also on show for the first time is a selection of images taken by members of the royal family themselves.
    

            Nearly 1,000 images were submitted from people around the world who were keen to share their encounters with royals, with photographs ranging from royal walkabouts in the 1950s to the traditional Christmas Day service at Sandringham, the Queen’s private residence in Norfolk.

“What we saw in the terrible tragedy in Southend was an attack on democracy, on an open society, on freedom itself.

            Hosting duties for the Games could be shared between North and South Korea, after the South Korean capital sent proposals to the International 
 Committee (IOC) to co-host with North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang.
    

            In a press release, the Seoul city government said the Games could serve as a “watershed moment” for peace in the Korean Peninsula.
    

            When the IOC originally announced that Brisbane was the preferred location for the 2032 Olympic Games, South Korean national government and Seoul city government officials expressed their “regret” in a statement. 
    

            

    

            It is not clear when the IOC will announce its official selection for the 2032 games, although in February, the IOC 
 Brisbane was the “preferred host” for the 2032 Summer Olympics. 
    

            Named “Beyond the Line, Toward the Future”, the Seoul government said in a press release that it hoped the “Games could be a “catalyst that serves both the IOC’s vision of sports bringing world peace, and the long-standing wish of the South Korean government to achieve peace and harmony on the Korean Peninsula.”
    

            According to a Unification Ministry press release from December 14, 2018, North and South Korea agreed to send a joint proposal to the IOC on hosting 2032 Games together “in a close future.”
    

            They also discussed attending the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games together, even forming a single joint team together, the Ministry said.
    

            

    

            According to North Korean state news agency KCNA, the North Korean Olympic Committee met on Friday, March 26, but there were no details published about the 2032 bid, specifically. 
    

            The report cited North Korean officials’ hope that athletes from the North would win more medals at international competitions over the next five years to “add glory to our dignified nation.”

French-born Guinean player stormed off field in protest
Italian Football Federation launches investigation into incident

            The new football season is still some weeks away, but already in Italy allegations of racial abuse towards AC Milan’s Kevin Constant have marred a friendly.
    

            The French-born Guinean player smashed the ball into the stands and walked off the pitch during Tuesday’s friendly game against Sassuolo in the northern city of Reggio Emilia after becoming enraged by a section of supporters.
    

            The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) confirmed Wednesday that it was examining the incident.
    

            “The Federal Prosecutor’s Office has opened an investigation to ascertain the extent of the racist incident that took place yesterday evening at the Stadio del Tricolore in Reggio Emilia during the Milan-Sassuolo match (Trofeo TIM), which saw AC Milan player Kevin Constant the subject of chants from some supporters in the stands” said the FIGC statement.
    

            In January, Constant’s teammate Kevin Prince-Boateng walked off the field of play after being racially abused by a number of fans during a friendly game against Pro Patria with six people hit with two-month prison sentences.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            However Milan said that Constant’s decision to leave the field was “not a decision he should have taken upon himself to make.”
    

            “On the evening of July 23rd 2013 there was another episode involving racist intolerance and this time the victim was Kevin Constant, who reacted by leaving the field of play,” read the Milan statement.
    

            “This was not a decision he should have taken upon himself to make and despite his more than understandable reasons and the anger he must have felt, AC Milan would like to remind everyone that the only people responsible for intervening against any manifestations that offend the human dignity, which includes racial discrimination, are the referee in charge of the match and the head of public safety. 
    

            “The use of the legal system and institutional rights, which every member of the public requires to exist in a civil society, does not compensate for the fact that these episodes continue to happen at a frequent rate.”
    

            

    

            Both Constant and Prince-Boateng declined to be interviewed by CNN, while Sassuolo issued the following statement on its website.
    

            “With reference to the incident that occurred during the Trofeo TIM, Sassuolo Calcio await the results of the investigation and fully condemn any racist expression,” it read.
    

            “In any case, we also underline the extraordinary fair play of Sassuolo fans in general. Over the years and during the Trofeo TIM last night they supported their team with the utmost sporting values, never transcending into vulgar chants and ensuring visiting fans enjoyed their hospitality.”
    

            The incident is the latest in a long line of unsavory episodes of racism which have dogged Italian football in recent times.
    

            Only last May, the FIGC itself came under fire from FIFA president Sepp Blatter after the Italian organization fined Roma $65,000 after its fans were found guilty of racially abusing Milan’s Mario Balotelli.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            “You will always find money,” Blatter told the world governing body’s website at the time.
    

            “What is $65,000 for such an incident? I’m not happy and I will call the Italian Federation. That’s not a way to deal with such matters.”
    

            In April, Inter Milan were fined nearly $60,000 by European governing body UEFA after its fans were found guilty of “improper conduct” in chants directed towards Tottenham Hotspur striker Emmanuel Adebayor.
    

            Two months earlier, Lazio received its fourth charge of racist behavior this season – with Roma’s city rivals having been fined nearly $300,000 after repeated fan transgressions.
    

            In May, FIFA adopted tougher penalties for racist behavior during its congress in Mauritius.
    

            Punishments for first offenses bring a warning, fine or clubs being forced to play games in empty stadiums. A second offense, or one deemed “serious,” could result in demotion, a deduction of points or expulsion from a tournament.
    

            FIFA also confirmed that any individual found guilty of racist chanting will be suspended for at least five matches.
    

            According to UEFA guidelines, which are adhered to by all professional clubs in Europe, there is a three-step procedure for abandoning games if they are marred by racist chanting. 
    

            First, the referee should halt the contest and ask for announcements to be made over the public address system. 
    

            The second step would be to suspend the match for a given period of time and, finally, abandon it.

Axel Witsel also nets with header

            Belgium recorded its first points of 
 with a comfortable victory over the Republic of Ireland, courtesy of  Romelu Lukaku’s brace and Axel Witsel’s pinpoint header.
    

            Ranked no. 2 in the world by FIFA and backed by many to go on and win the tournament, Marc Wilmots’ side flattered to deceive in its opener against Italy, putting in a limp display on its way to a 2-0 defeat.
    

            Ireland, conversely, went into the game in relatively high spirits. A positive display against Sweden was only lacking the luck of the Irish, as Ciaran Clark’s unfortunate own goal denied them all three points.
    

            In the opening 45 minutes, it looked as though Belgium would once against disappoint, with pressure growing on Wilmots should he arguably continue to not make the most of this “golden generation” of players.
    
Belgium back in the groove with 3-0 win.
 
 

            However, two minutes into the second half the team’s quality eventually told.
    

            It was a controversial opener, with Ireland feeling aggrieved not to have been given a penalty for a high foot on Shane Long.
    

            

    

            In the blink of an eye, while several Irish players were still remonstrating with referee Cüneyt Çakir, Belgium counter-attacked through Kevin De Bruyne. 
    

            The Manchester City star’s piercing run bypassed the entire opposition midfield, before setting up Lukaku who curled the ball brilliantly past Darren Randolph’s despairing dive.
    

            

    

            While Ireland still posed a threat, the Belgians began to exert their dominance on proceedings and doubled their lead just after the hour mark.
    
Belgium strung together 28 consecutive passes for their second goal 👏
 
 

            Patient play around the edge of the Ireland box culminated in Thomas Meunier crossing into the box, with Witsel running onto the ball and powering a header into the bottom corner.
    

            Not long after it was game over, Eden Hazard this time leading another blistering counter-attack, bypassing Clarke’s lunge on the halfway line and eventually squaring for Lukaku to tap home for his second goal.
    

            Saying that the Belgium squad was full of “big personalities,” Lukaku told ITV that the team was now on the “same page” after Saturday’s win.
    

            

    

            Given Belgium’s ranking – only Argentina is above them – and the ludicrously talented group of players at his disposal, Wilmots will look to maintain the momentum gained from this win in the final group game against Sweden.
    

            Belgium’s victory in Bordeaux ensures Italy goes through as Group E winner, with the Republic of Ireland needing a win against Antonio Conte’s side to have any chance of reaching the last 16.

Maher was the 2018 overall winner

            Julien Epaillard edged out defending champion Ben Maher by a whisker to win the first leg of the Longines Global Champions Tour in Doha.
    

            Epaillard, of France, and his horse Usual Suspect d’Auge raced to victory by producing a clear round in the jump-off in a time of 40.11 seconds, just 0.44 seconds faster than Britain’s Maher and Explosion W, the overall circuit winners in 2018. 
    

            “It’s crazy for me, today,” Epaillard said in a televised interview, after riding away with prize money of €123,750 ($140,733).
    

             “Normally I have another horse to ride the Grand Prix today, but he had a little thing and then I changed my plan,” he said. “I ride him today and I was so surprised for the first one to be clear. And then at the jump-off, only five riders, I say, OK, try the best. And it worked today. It’s nice.”
    

            

    

            Now in its 14th year, the Longines Global Champions Tour, along with the Global Champions League, is recognized as show jumping’s richest circuit. It has expanded to 20 legs this season, with new stops added in New York, Stockholm and Montreal. 
    

            Held in the vast, sandy arena at the state-of-the-art Al Shaqab Equestrian Facility in Doha, the season opener attracted 50 riders and 99 horses. 
    

            Uliano Vezzani’s challenging course over jumps as high as 1.6 meters saw only five riders qualifying for the jump-off on a clear, cool night in Doha.
    

            As the first rider in the jump-off, Epaillard and Usual Suspect d’Auge, an 11-year-old French-bred gelding, set the pace, going clear in a time of 40.11 seconds. 
    

      
      

      

    

            With the next two riders, Italy’s Alberto Zorzi and Holland’s Frank Schuttert, both dropping a pole, Belgium’s Nicola Philippaerts and H&M Chilli Willi played it safe as they produced a clear round in 43.43 seconds. 
    

            “I just tried to go quick enough and tried to stay clear and be on the podium,” Philippaerts said in a news conference.
    

            The last to go, it was all in Maher’s hands as he guided Explosion W over the fences at a rapid pace, only to come up short in the last turn into the final stretch.
    

            Watching from the warm-up arena, Epaillard clenched his fist and let out a roar when he saw Maher’s time.
    

            “Just misjudged it today, he’s naturally very fast and we just weren’t good enough to beat Julien today,” said Maher, who won in Madrid, Paris, Rome and Doha on Explosion W last season. “Today he was very fast. That’s sport, and that’s the way it goes.” 
    

            

    

            Epaillard had finished in second place no less than three times earlier in the week in Doha.
    

            “I was not thinking, really, to win the Grand Prix,” Epaillard said. “It’s fantastic, the horse is amazing. It’s his second Global Champions League Grand Prix, he already won in Paris, and now here, I am very happy to ride him.”
    

            His win in Doha means Epaillard is the first rider of the 2019 season to secure a spot in the lucrative Super Grand Prix in Prague, at the end of the season in November. 
    

            “It feels very good,” said the Frenchman. “Prague is an amazing place, I had a chance to ride there last year, it was a super show and already exciting to ride there.”
    

            

    

            Earlier on Saturday, the two-day Global Champions League (GCL) team event was won by Shanghai Swans, with Germany’s Daniel Deusser and Switzerland’s Pius Schwizer both producing a double clear.
    

            Valkenswaard United finished second while New York Empire were in third place. 
    

            “We have a very good team, but still in the end you have to get the job done,” Deusser told the GCL website. “We had a strong day on Thursday, and two clear rounds today – I have a super partner with Pius, so we’re very happy.”
    

            With 16 teams of six riders each, one more than last year, the competition will be fierce this season.
    

            “I expected more teams on a double clear today, but it showed the course was tough,” said Deusser. “There were faults everywhere. It’s a long season, but the first step is done so we hope to continue like this,” he added.
    

            “Very proud of my horse, how he jumped today,” Schuttert, of Valkenswaard United, said. “Hopefully, next time we can climb one spot up.”
    

            London Knights, last year’s overall Global Champions League winners led by former Olympic champion Maher, finished in fifth place in Doha, just behind Madrid in Motion, who had triumphed in the first-ever GCL Super Cup at the GC Prague Playoffs in December.

            “It does not fit into our society for us, for our communication, for our cohesion in the society…. This is why we demand you show your face.”
    

            The proposed partial ban is to promote security and national cohesion, de Maiziere said, denying that plans for the ban were to appease the increasingly popular right-wing AFD party.
    

            “We do what we deem is right, and the AFD can behave in their own way,” he said.
    

            Berlin Interior Minister Frank Henkel supported the proposal, adding that the full-face veil “does not fit in with our understanding of a tolerant, free society. It does not fit in with our view of women.”
    

            De Maziere also said that Germany would mull stricter child marriage laws and that the justice minister was already looking into the issue, adding that “a child marriage is not accepted in Germany.”
    

            The proposal follows a series of bans on clothing deemed religious – including burkinis – at some French beaches.
    

            Cannes, a city on the French Riviera famous for its annual film festival, banned the religious swimwear in the wake of recent terror attacks in France and other western European countries.
    

            Those breaking the temporary ban, which runs from July 28 until August 31, face fines of €38 ($42), said the Cannes mayor’s office. 
    

            

    

            The French beach ban also comes as a planned burkini-only day for Muslim women at a water park near Marseille was canceled by city officials, after threats were sent to the event’s organizers.
    

            The private event, organized by the women’s community group Smile 13, sparked outrage among some politicians and French citizens who claimed it was an affront to France’s rigorously enforced secularism.
    

            

    

            Germany’s proposal follows similar bans in France, Belgium and Switzerland. 
    

            In April 2011, France became the first European country to ban wearing in public the burqa, a full-body covering that includes mesh over the face, and the niqab, a full-face veil with an opening for the eyes.
    

        Full-face veils, we reject this. Not just the burqa… It does not fit into our society… this is why we demand that you show your face
    

            Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere 
        

            Those 
 face fines of 150 euros (about $205) or public service duties.
    

            The law was upheld by the 
 after a 24-year-old woman brought the case to court, claiming it infringed on her religious freedom.
    

            The government also previously 
 and other “conspicuous” religious symbols in French schools, in February 2004.
    

            The laws have been criticized by religious freedom advocates but supported by others who see the Islamic veil as demeaning to women and inconsistent with France’s rigorously enforced secularism.

Two-thirds of Ukrainians back sanctions against Russia, CNN poll finds
Ukrainians tend to see Putin as dangerous and strong, and Obama as friendly
More than half of Ukrainians say the country should ally with Europe

            Ukrainians are a lot less pro-Russian than separatists there would like the world to believe, even in regions along the border with Russia which are supposedly voting overwhelmingly to declare independence from Ukraine, a new poll for CNN suggests.
    

            The people of Ukraine feel much more loyal to Europe than to Russia, and a clear majority back economic sanctions against Russia, according to the poll of 1,000 people across the country conducted in the past week.
    

            Two out of three (67%) people in Ukraine approve of economic sanctions against Russia, while one out of three (29%) disapproves, the poll by ComRes for CNN found. 
    

            Ukrainians tend to see Russian President Vladimir Putin as dangerous and a strong leader, while they consider U.S. President Barack Obama friendly.
    

            More than half (56%) said they felt a stronger sense of loyalty to Europe than to Russia, while 19% said they felt more loyal to Russia and 22% said neither. Three percent said they didn’t know.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            The results come a day after pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country said people there had voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence from Ukraine, in a referendum denounced by the United States and its European allies.
    

            

    

            The CNN poll found that even in eastern Ukraine, a minority of people back an alliance with Russia.
    

            Just over a third (37%) of Ukrainians in three eastern regions favor an alliance with Russia, while 14% of the region backs an alliance with the European Union and about half (49%) say Ukraine would be better off if it did not ally with either, the poll found. 
    

            “Eastern Ukraine” includes the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv, which are generally seen as among the most pro-Russian areas in the country.
    

            Donetsk and Luhansk held referendums on independence on Sunday, with an election official in Donetsk saying Monday the region had voted 90% in favor.
    

            Nationwide, a slight majority (54%) said it would be good for Ukraine to join the EU. More than eight out of 10 (82%) said it would be bad for the country to have Russian troops in Ukraine.
    

            And despite the crisis that has pitted Russia against the United States and European Union over the fate of the second-largest country in Europe, Ukrainians are optimistic about the future. 
    

            Two out of three people said they were optimistic about the political future of the country (65%) and the same proportion (67%) said they were optimistic about its economic future. 
    

            

    

            Nearly half (44%) of respondents to the CNN poll said Putin was a strong leader, compared to 27% who saw Obama that way. About a quarter (23%) said neither and six percent said they didn’t know.
    

            Two-thirds (67%) described Putin as “dangerous,” while only 15% saw Obama that way.
    

            But Obama came out well ahead of Putin as “friendly,” with 47% applying the description to the U.S. President and only 14% saying it of Putin. About a third (34%) said neither was friendly, and five percent said they didn’t know. 
    

            Neither leader came across as especially reliable, with 32% choosing Obama, 19% choosing Putin and 45% saying neither. 
    

            The findings, by the London-based agency ComRes for CNN, come from a nationally representative telephone poll of 1,000 Ukrainians conducted by telephone in Russian and Ukrainian from May 7-11.  The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

            At least six people were killed and several others injured in an avalanche that struck the French Alps over the weekend.
    

            Emergency workers were deployed after the incident at the Armancette glacier near Mont Blanc in southeast France, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin tweeted on Sunday. Rescue work is ongoing. 
    

            Clouds of snow rolled down the mountainside, according to video footage shared by Reuters that was tweeted by a nearby ski station, Contamines-Montjoie.
    

            The avalanche occurred at the glacier on Sunday. The conditions on the mountain were described as “not particularly alarming,” with the president of France’s mountain guide union, Dorian Labaeye, telling France Info that he did not know how such a tragedy could have happened in “good conditions.”
    

            The avalanche spread across an area of 1 kilometer by 500 meters, at an altitude of 3,500 meters (11,480 feet), according to a spokesperson for the local authorities of Haute-Savoie, Reuters reported. 
    

            The people swept away by the avalanche were backcountry skiing and the identities of the victims are being confirmed. 
    

            The mayor of the town of Contamines-Montjoie, Francois Barbier, told Agence France-Presse it was “the most deadly avalanche this season.”
    

            “It is a very big avalanche on a busy route at this time of the year,” Labaeye said, adding, “We have tens of thousands of people doing ski touring at the moment in the Alps. There are usually lots of people on the Easter weekend and conditions are usually pretty stable at this time of year.”
    

            Labaeye said he did not believe there were any other victims. He said the group impacted was equipped with an avalanche detector, shovels, and probes, which he said “facilitates the work of the rescuers.”
    

            French President Emmanuel Macron sent his condolences to the victims and their loved ones.
    

            “At the Armancette glacier in the Alps, an avalanche has caused casualties. We are thinking of them and their families. Our rescue forces have been mobilized to find people still stuck in the snow. Our thoughts are with them too,” Macron tweeted on Sunday.

Celtic held 1-1 by Slovenian side Maribor in Champions League playoff
Scottish champion will host second leg next Wednesday
Celtic qualified after Legia Warsaw was thrown out of competition 
Porto claims 1-0 win at Lille

            Do you believe in second chances? It would appear that those wearing the green and white of Celtic do.
    

            Having been handed a brutal beating by Polish side Legia Warsaw in the third qualifying round of the Champions League, Celtic’s European adventure appeared to be over before it had started.
    

            A 4-1 defeat in the Polish capital was followed by a 2-0  home defeat – a result which should have sent Legia through to the playoff stage.
    

            Except it didn’t. Instead, UEFA, the game’s European governing body, was called in to rule over claims Legia had fielded an ineligible player during the tie.
    

            Bartosz Bereszynski, who entered the action with two minutes of the second leg remaining, was supposed to be serving a ban.
    

            It was his presence on the field which meant UEFA awarded the game to Celtic 3-0, making it 4-4 on aggregate and allowing the Scottish champion to progress on away goals.
    

            While Legia protested, even taking their failed case to CAS, the Court for the Arbitration of Sport, Celtic ensured it made the most of it fortune.
    

            A game against Slovenian champion Maribor was Celtic’s reward with the opportunity to play some of European football’s biggest names the prize.
    

            Celtic, which won the European Cup in 1967, took the lead within six minutes of the kickoff when Callum McGregor fired home from close range after Jo Inge Berget’s effort was diverted into his path.
    

            Maribor, which last reached the group stage of the tournament in 1999, overcame Maccabi Tel Aviv 3-2 on aggregate in the previous round.
    

            And it soon carved Celtic open to claim a deserved equalizer when Damjar Bohar ran through to slot the ball past the onrushing Craig Gordon.
    

            Both teams had opportunities to win the game with Charlie Mulgrew and Virgil van Dijk going close for the visitors, while Tavares’ rasping effort flew just over the crossbar for Maribor.
    

            The two will meet again next Tuesday with Celtic now the firm favorite to progress following the 1-1 draw.
    

            Elsewhere,
, the 2004 champion, gained an impressive 1-0 win at French side 
.
    

            Hector Herrera’s 61st minute strike was enough to give Porto a slender advantage going into next week’s second leg.
    

            In Belgium, Oleg Shatov scored the only goal of the game as 
 recorded a 1-0 away win at Standard Liege.
    

            In the night’s other games, Slovan Bratislava drew 1-1 with BATE Borisov, while Aalborg and Apoel finished 1-1.

            What started with claims in a German magazine has resulted in 
 from European club competitions for two seasons and fined $32.5 million. 
    

            UEFA’s decision to punish the reigning 
 after it found the club had committed “serious breaches” of the European governing body’s club licensing and financial fair play regulations has led to shock, denial and plenty of questions. 
    

      
      

      

    

            The punishment is subject to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and City immediately
describing UEFA’s process as “flawed” and making it clear the fight is not over. 
    

            But how did it come to this and what now for one of the world’s richest football clubs and its manager 

    

            In November 2018, German magazine Der Spiegel reported that City and its sponsors manipulated contracts to circumvent UEFA’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, introduced in 2011 to stop clubs overspending. 
    

            Leaked emails obtained by Der Spiegel from the Football Leaks organization suggested City’s Abu Dhabi owners had paid the club directly rather than Etihad, which is the club’s shirt sponsor and has naming rights for its stadium. Der Spiegel, citing club documents, alleged the airline financed only part of the sponsorship deal, with the owners coming up with the rest.
    

            

    

            FFP rules state clubs can only lose $32 million over three seasons otherwise they will be liable to a fine or suspension. 
    

            Last March UEFA began its investigation and in May the case was 
 the financial control body adjudicatory chamber (CFCB), with City filing an appeal to CAS in June, which was rejected in November 2019. 
    

            On Friday, CFCB said City had broken the rules and, significantly, “failed to cooperate in the investigation.” In its statement, City said the emails had been taken out of context and the case had been “initiated by UEFA, prosecuted by UEFA and judged by UEFA.” 
    

            In the immediate aftermath, the future of Guardiola, widely regarded as the finest manager of his era, has been the main focus. 
    

            The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach has previously maintained he would remain at City at least until his contract expires in 

    

            Under Guardiola’s leadership, City has broken records and played mesmerizing football. 
    

            In winning the EPL in 2017-18, City became the first English club to record a 100-point haul. And in successfully 
and securing the FA Cup and League Cup last season, the club became the first to win all
 in a single campaign. 
    

            But in his four years in Manchester, one trophy has eluded him, which was the main reason he was brought to the club – the Champions League, the richest competition in European football. 
    

            Only last week Guardiola talked of how he might be sacked if he does not win European football’s top prize soon. That statement may have been overdramatic, but if UEFA’s decision is upheld, Guardiola needs to win the Champions League this season or likely face never winning the trophy he covets the most with City. 
    

            Will Guardiola be happy to wait until 2023 to restart his Champions League quest with City? By the end of his present contract, he will have stayed at City longer than at any of his previous clubs. And with unprecedented heights already scaled on the domestic front, many are asking what would motivate him to stay. 
    

            Even before Friday’s seismic punishment,  it had become clear City would have to rebuild in the summer. 
    

            With Liverpool currently 22 points ahead of City in the league, the club needs an injection of players if it is to reclaim its position as the dominant team in England. 
    

            Veteran midfielder David Silva is to leave at the end of the season. It is uncertain whether striker Sergio Aguero, City’s all-time leading scorer, will remain beyond his current deal, which ends in 2021. Young forward Leroy Sane is also being heavily linked with a move to Bayern Munich. 
    

            If Guardiola leaves, so could a number of other stars. Raheem Sterling and Kevin de Bruyne are in long-term deals, but they will want to test themselves against the best. 
    

            With rich owners, money is not a problem for City – but without the prestige of Champions League football, will City still be able to attract elite players? UEFA’s punishment has shaken City. It could also lead to an end of an era.

 in front of the Swedish parliament on Friday, just like she has almost every week for the past year. 
    

            Wearing a yellow raincoat, her long brown hair in a single braid, the 16-year-old Thunberg held her now famous 
 placard. 
    

            “The climate crisis doesn’t go on summer holiday, and neither will we,” the teenage activist said in a tweet to rally her supporters around the world. 
    

            For the past year, Thunberg’s weekly sit-ins outside the parliament have gained a worldwide following, with 
.
    

            The climate strikes appeared to nudge some of those in power. German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the students for taking action. After initial reluctance, her government joined the European efforts to adopt an EU-wide emission target. In the UK, parliament 
 and adopted 
, partly in response to the protests. 
    

            Elsewhere, the students’ actions were met with much less enthusiasm.  
    

            In the Czech Republic, their efforts fell on deaf ears. 
    

            “In response to our first strike, the [Czech parliament] debated climate change,” the organizers of the protests in the Czech Republic said in a statement. “But the meeting only lasted a few hours and more than half of the deputies left the chamber at its start…we demanded action, but we were ridiculed and ignored.”
    

      
      

      

    

            Despite the students efforts in the streets, the Czech government was among the nations 
. The plan, debated at the European summit in June, would have resulted in the elimination of most greenhouse emissions in the bloc by 2050. 
    

            Apart from the Czech Republic, three other member states – Poland, Estonia and Hungary, vetoed the plan. “Why should we decide 31 years ahead of time what will happen in 2050?,” Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis told reporters at the meeting. 
    

            “This exact kind of behavior is and was the reason why we started striking,” Eva Matoušová, one of the Czech organizers of the student strikes, told CNN.
    

            Matoušová said that while there won’t be official strikes over the summer, smaller, more local events will take place. The next major nationwide strike in the country is planned for September 20. 
    

            “The Czech government’s ongoing inability to take climate seriously is alarming… . It’s clear that our common future is not their priority and that needs to change,” she said.
    

            The result of the summit reflects, at least partly, the attitudes of people across the EU. According to 
, a public opinion survey conducted by the European Commission in 2017, only 22% of Czechs, the lowest proportion in the entire EU, thought climate change was one of the four most serious problems facing the world. Poles, with 27%, were second to last. 
    

            Yet in Sweden, one of the countries that pushed for the plan, 76% of people think climate change is the single most serious problem the world is facing. 
    

            Thomas Bernauer, the director of the Institute of Science, Technology and Policy at ETH Zurich university, said the divide comes down largely to economics. 
    

            “In the wealthier European countries like Switzerland, or Germany, or Scandinavia, people have reached a certain level of well-being and pay attention to issues that go beyond their daily needs,” he said.
    

            “If you’re in a very rich, liberal society, and you have a certain job, a sufficient income, enough food, housing, and so on, basically, you’re contained on the material level, of course you can redefine things like climate change into something that is a basic need… . But say you’re in Bulgaria or Portugal, and there’s a 30% unemployment, and you have no prospects of finding a job, then it’s a very different calculus,” he said.
    

      
      

      

    

            The current European divide over climate policy illustrates much deeper economic, political and cultural divisions within the bloc, according to Mike Hulme, professor of Human Geography at the University of Cambridge, in the United Kingdom.
    

            “You have 28 countries at very different stages of economic development… . It’s partly about political leadership, it’s partly about cultural values, norms, partly about religious beliefs, it’s partly about geopolitics, and the perceptions of who holds power and influence in the world,” he said.

            It’s a practical question, too. Poland is the second largest coal producer in Europe. As much as 80% of its electricity comes from coal-burning plants. The sector employs tens of thousands of people, and is seen as strategic, allowing Poland the freedom of not relying on gas from Russian.
    

            “It’s a much easier thing to become emissions free when a country has other alternatives,” said Darrick Evensen, lecturer in Environmental Politics at the University of Edinburgh. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Politics is increasingly playing a role in the fight against climate change. In recent European election, Green parties scored significant victories, a reflection of the topic being on the minds of the voters.
    

            Climate change policies generally suffer from the discrepancy between their costs and benefits. The costs are high and imminent. Phasing out fossil fuels, which scientists say is necessary in order to limit global warming, will require huge investments into new technologies.
    

            The benefits, on the other hand, might only become apparent by the end of the century, when most of those paying the costs now will be long gone. That makes it hard for politicians to push for a change.
    

            “With environmental issues you’re not seeing any near-term payout, that’s the problem,” said Darrick Evensen, lecturer in Environmental Politics at the University of Edinburgh. 
    

            “But that’s something that may be changing because of the protests, the politicians are starting to see, and we’re seeing this in the UK, they do see a near-term payout for climate change legislation, because it can get them into power,” he said. 
    

            It’s a calculation that works only when there are no other major issues. “If there’s an economic crisis, urgency to create jobs, high inflation, or other things that create a lot of misery for people, those are the things that the electorate wants to be dealt with as a priority, but that doesn’t mean that climate change is irrelevant,” said Bernauer. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Sweden is one of only a handful of countries that have adopted emission reduction targets in an effort to tackle climate change. On the international stage, the Swedes have been championing action on fossil fuels.

            She says she won’t stop until Sweden is in line with the Paris Agreement. The 2015 accord aims to limit a global temperature rise this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius by dramatically cutting carbon emissions. 
    

            According to Climate Action Network Europe, a coalition of NGOs, no European country, not even Sweden, is on track to fully meet its targets.

            The coastal golf resort that used to be known simply as Turnberry is now “Trump Turnberry,” and I am waiting for the man who put his name on it.
    

            I’m looking out from the hotel at a stunning view of the golf course as it undulates into the sea when an American voice asks whether I am enjoying my stay.
    

      
      

      

    

            I say it’s lovely, and he says he’s Eric Trump, Donald’s son. Once he identified himself, I could see the similarity, but he’s perhaps a more formal, contained version of his father.
    

            Eric is keen to tell me the hotel is being entirely renovated. He points to some rotten wood paneling in the corner of the room and says: “That’s not very Trump.”
    

            What is very Trump is his father’s arrival. 
    

            The Trump chopper comes in to land right outside the entrance to the hotel. “Trump” is emblazoned in red across the tail.
    

            The man himself is swamped by camera crews almost as soon as he steps off, and it suddenly feels like another campaign stop for the man leading the large Republican field of presidential hopefuls in polls.
    

      
      

      

    

            Scottish reporters bombard him with questions about illegal Mexican immigrants – Trump has claimed “rapists” and “killers” are migrating over the United States’ southern border.  He takes the questioning in his stride. It’s a case of “give me what you’ve got.”
    

            He is asked what section of America he represents.
    

            “A big section,” he says, citing his lead in the polls. 
    

            The reporters press on: Not many of the immigrant population though?
    

            In fact, he argues, one poll showed he was No. 1 with Hispanics. (I should add that wasn’t a national poll.)
    

            When he’s done, Trump turns around and enters his hotel where he’s swamped by an entourage instead including security, siblings and senior staff. 
    

            He picks out employees with whom he wants to talk business. He asks whether the helicopter landing looked “smooth.”
    

            There’s no doubt the man has charm and charisma. He owns the room when he comes in. He picks people out, and they are flattered. Yes, that might be because he’s the boss, but he has respect as a fly-in business leader.  
    

            His guests on the golf course, meanwhile, are enjoying the British Women’s Open. They tended to respect him as a businessman, but were damning of his political views.
    

            “He’s doing a good job of the course, but to me the man himself is a bit of a joke,” says one man. Another said: “His recent comments about Mexicans and things seem very silly comments to me however he has a history of fantastic things for golf …  as a person, no thanks but I can’t fault his business.” A female tournament watcher said: “He’s not very people friendly. He’s a very selfish self-centered man with his own opinions about how he wants to do things.”
    

            We were invited to a news conference that was restricted to “the subjects of golf, Turnberry and the tournament.”
    

            That was never going to fly.  
    

            As we waited, a British journalist behind me was asking “How does he come in?!” as if there might be fireworks might be an option. Trump’s reputation certainly precedes him. 
    

            A volley of camera shutters herald the arrival of the man himself into the room, and he headed to the podium to talk Turnberry, and confirming he will answer some “unrelated questions.”
    

            He invites the golf course architect to speak first about his work and Trump walks to the back of the room to listen. 
    

            The problem is that the cameras follow Trump. Rather awkwardly, the architect delivers his presentation to the back of photographers’ heads.
    

            When he architect is done, Trump returns to the podium and takes questions, which range wildly from immigration to Vladimir Putin, China, Scottish separatism and even big game hunting. 
    

            He gives everything a positive spin, usually referring to his positive polling. 
    

            Golf reporters sat back as American politics take center stage in this Scottish coastal resort. 
    

            There’s little new in what Trump says, but he does answer the questions directly – apart from one unsuspecting reporter who got tangled in his words. Trump refused to answer on the grounds that the reporter couldn’t ask the question.
    

            Call it The Trump Show or a media feeding frenzy, but The Donald knows how to court attention.
    

            In politics, that can be divisive but, as a business leader, he’s a uniting figure, at least in this corner of Scotland.

In 2010 the church ruled that he had cured a nun of Parkinson's disease
A second recognized miracle would make him eligible to be a saint

            The committee that considers candidates for sainthood voted Tuesday to credit the late pope with a second miracle, the source said, asking not to be named discussing internal Vatican deliberations.
    

            It is not clear which of several miracles under consideration would be credited to the late pope. Pope Francis must now sign off on the decision before it is official.

            For beatification, a person must be credited with a miracle by the Catholic Church.

            World No.3 Luke Donald missed the halfway cut for the first time in his career after failing to shine at the rain-delayed Malaysia Open.
    

            Donald recorded rounds of 73 and 74, leaving him three shots off the cut mark after enduring troubles with his putter.

            “I’ve got a couple of weeks off to get ready for Augusta and I’ll obviously be very diligent in my preparation,” Donald told reporters.

            On Monday, defending champions Real Madrid were drawn against big spending Paris Saint-Germain in what will be the stand-out tie of the Champions League last 16 stage. 
    

            It is a match which will put Cristiano Ronaldo – a five-time Ballon d’Or winner and the highest scorer in the tournament’s history – against Neymar, the world’s most expensive player.
    

            With 25 goals, PSG finished the group stages with a record number of goals scored and, before the last-16 draw, were the bookmakers’ favorites to win European football’s biggest club competition. 
    

            But the two-legged tie, the first of which will be played on February 14, against Real Madrid will be a first litmus test of PSG’s Champions League ambitions after the recruitment of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe last summer.
    

            

    

            

    

            Other last-16 highlights include former champions Chelsea versus five-time winners Barcelona and Juventus’ clash against Tottenham Hotspur, who beat Real 3-1 at home in the group stages.

That year Chelsea went on to win the competition after beating Bayern Munich in the final following a penalty shootout.
    

            In Chelsea’s favor, however, is Lionel Messi’s record against the London-based club as the Barcelona forward has failed to score against them in eight matches. The first leg of that tie will be played on February 20. 
    

            The Blues are one of five English sides in the competition – no country has ever had as big a representation in the knockout stages.

            Nico Rosberg believes he has taken “one step in the right direction” after ending world champion teammate Lewis Hamilton’s dominance of qualifying in the 2015 Formula One season.
    

            Mercedes will have both cars on the front row of the grid for Sunday’s Spanish Grand Prix but this time Rosberg will be first as Hamilton failed to secure a fifth successive pole position.
    

            The German clocked  one minute and 24.681 seconds to be 0.267s quicker than Hamilton – and also faster than Hamilton’s effort last year in securing the top qualifying spot at the Circuit de Catalunya.
    

            Hamilton won that race – one of eight times in the past 10 Spanish GPs where the polesitter has triumphed.
    

            “Of course I needed it sooner rather than later,” said Rosberg, 

    

            “It is one step in the right direction to winning the race. It was a good day in the office.” 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Rosberg earned pole in 2013 but finished sixth as Fernando Alonso won the race. The Spaniard is one of eight different winners in the last eight years in Barcelona. 
    

            “Strategy is important,” Rosberg told reporters. “It’s a big advantage to have a new set of used tires for the race. Overtaking is more difficult around here, so starting in front is a big advantage.”
    

            Hamilton was just over half a second quicker than Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who was 0.236s faster than Williams’ fourth-placed Valtteri Bottas.
    

            “Nico did a great job,” the English driver said. “I didn’t have the balance where I liked. Tomorrow there’s still a lot to play for.
    

            “I didn’t think I was on the back foot, I just didn’t have pace today and didn’t do a great job.”
    

            Four-time world champion Vettel, who won the 2011 race in Spain when at Red Bull, said he was encouraged by Ferrari’s continued strong showing.
    

            “I think it is great for Ferrari to keep confirming how close we are. This is a great race for us – it is very nearly a home race for us,” said the German, referring to the Italian team’s Spanish banking sponsor.
    

            Vettel’s teammate Kimi Raikkonen, who was second in Bahrain, had less sucess in Saturday’s qualifying and will start the race seventh behind Toro Rosso’s impressive rookies Carlos Sainz Jnr. and Max Verstappen.
    

            “If we have a good start we can go from there,” said the veteran Finn, who won Ferrari’s last world title back in 2007.  “I’m sure we have the speed to have a good race.”
    

            The young Toro Rosso duo once again outperformed their colleagues at senior team Red Bull, with Danil Kvyat qualifying eighth and Daniel Ricciardo 10th, while Williams veteran Felipe Massa was ninth.
    

            Sainz is racing in front of his home fans for the first time, but the 20-year-old played down expectations despite his best qualifying performance so far.
    

            “There is a Ferrari behind that has the best race pace of the whole field and a Williams that has 12 kph more top speed than us, then we have two Red Bulls,” said the son of former rally champion Carlos Sainz.
    

            “For the first time in the season, I was waving to the crowd and it felt like a pole position.”
    

            McLaren failed to reach Q3, but again showed slight improvement as Alonso –

            Specifically, it has focused on what both hopefuls 
 in order to deliver Brexit.
    

            However, both candidates are promising things that the evidence of the past two years suggests are impossible. 
    

            Both men seem to believe that they can convince the European Union to renegotiate 
. They believe that they can get the EU to tweak or remove 
, which has, to date, been the main reason that May failed to get her deal approved by the UK parliament. 
    

            Officials at all levels of the EU have been consistent in saying that this is not going to happen. And the EU has been remarkably consistent on its red lines during the whole Brexit process. 
    

            In the likely event that no concessions will be made to the deal – formally called the Withdrawal Agreement – both Johnson and Hunt say they are willing to take the UK out of the EU without a deal. This is an extraordinary thing to say, when you consider that Hunt only this week said that he knew that doing so would cost jobs. 
    

            Remarkably, these claims have not attracted the scrutiny one might hope, given the gravity of the situation. Instead, the candidates have been able to present vague policy and flawed logic on why they will make the EU budge as concrete reasons that they are the right person to lead the UK through its most serious crisis since World War II. 
    

            Johnson seems to think that his charm, enthusiasm and popularity will be enough to open up the negotiations; Hunt thinks that his history as an entrepreneur means he has a track record of brokering deals. Meanwhile, the EU looks on in astonishment. 
    

            It’s not just the leadership hopefuls, nor the hardline Brexiteers, who are living in this parallel universe. 
    

            The continuity-remainers who regret that Brexit ever happened and want to scrap it are entering their final push to convince the official opposition Labour party to back a second referendum. There’s two problems here. First, the party’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and his hard-left inner circle, are not exactly enamored with the European Union. Corbyn, it mustn’t be forgotten, voted to leave the European Economic Community (which became the European Union) in 1975. 
    

            Second, while everyone in this bitterly divided nation can point to opinion polls that back up their preferred outcome, the reality is that polling on a binary question is difficult. However, if you look at the most recent national election results in the UK, the picture is clear. 
    

            In last month’s EU elections, both Labour and the Conservatives finished behind the pro-no deal Brexit party (30.5% of the vote) and the pro-remain Liberal Democrats (19.6%). 
    

            So, with no hard evidence that remain could win a second referendum, continuing to oppose the only deal that the UK and EU have put on the table only serves to delay Brexit and leave everything murky. All of which makes a no-deal crash out on October 31 more likely. 
    

            The lack of clarity is already having an impact on the UK. 

    

            And a less told story is the precarious position the UK’s economy is in at the moment. Productivity is stalling, consumer credit is growing, wages are stagnant and current projections show the economy 

    

            If a no-deal Brexit is as catastrophic as predicted, this could create a perfect storm of job losses, citizens unable to pay off their debts and the economy tanking. This in turn, could lead to a run on the pound and interest rates rising – which is bad news for those with large debt. 
    

      
      

      

    

            But no one is talking about this. Instead, the nation is in denial, trapped in its Brexit paralysis and chest beating over the politics of the situation.
    

            It’s all getting very serious as the Halloween deadline approaches. The reality is that without a public vote Brexit cannot be stopped, that without changes to the Brexit deal it will not pass through parliament and that the EU is still not willing to make changes. 
    

            However, what might be possible is the new prime minister selling a fudge. The EU wants the UK to leave with a deal. Contrary to what many remainers believe, the EU’s preferred option is that the UK leaves under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement, then the two sides can talk about a future trading relationship. It’s here that the new PM might be able to get concessions from Europe, then try to sell those concessions as a huge victory to parliament. 
    

            It will be difficult, and it could become very messy. If a Brexiteer like Johnson ultimately ends up trying to pass Theresa May’s deal, the sense of betrayal among hardliners will be palpable. But right now, the UK’s options are limited. 
    

            Meanwhile, all of the aforementioned is ignored as the UK distracts itself with a pantomime, as though facts are meaningless. If all this sounds familiar, you could be right. The UK might be living through its very own 
 Trump moment.

Defending champion Tiger Woods ties for 65th after carding a level-par round of 72
Five-time winner Woods suffers a triple-bogey for the second successive day
World No. 2 Rory McIlroy finishes tied for 57th after also finishing with a 72

            There are only two multiple winners on the PGA Tour this season – one of them is in top form ahead of the U.S. Open, and the other is Tiger Woods.
    

            Matt Kuchar moved up to second place in the FedEx Cup standings with victory at Jack Nicklaus’ Memorial Tournament on Sunday, having finished runner-up last weekend at the Crowne Plaza Invitational.
    

            It is the first time the American has won more than once in one season, having also claimed the World Golf Championships Match Play title in February.
    

            His four-under-par 68 in the final round was crowned by a 21-foot birdie at the last hole which left him two shots clear of fast-finishing Kevin Chappell, who is still waiting for his breakthrough win.
    

            The biggest names in the field – world No. 1 Woods and second-ranked Rory McIlroy – were respectively nine and 13 shots off the pace after both carded par 72.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            

    

            For defending champion Woods, Sunday’s effort was a relative relief after Saturday’s nightmare 79 – his equal second-worst score as a professional – but he triple-bogeyed the par-three 12th hole that he had doubled in the third round. He also had a triple on Saturday.
    

            The American has won this event five times, but is struggling to regain the form that has already brought him four victories this season ahead of the second scheduled major at Merion in Pennsylvania starting June 13.
    

            “You want everything clicking on all cylinders, especially at the U.S. Open, because everything is tested in the U.S. Open,” he said.
    

            Woods is still four short of Nicklaus’ record 18 major titles, and has not won one since the 2008 U.S. Open. He was eight over the card at Muirfield Village. 
    

            “It wasn’t that bad today,” Woods said. “It was just one hole that cost me obviously a few shots. It happens, it happens to us all.”
    

            McIlroy is also struggling for form ahead of the tournament that provided his first major win in 2011.
    

            “I hit the ball much better today. I actually putted a little better, too. A little bit of work next week – yeah, it’s not that far away,” the Northern Irishman said after finishing in a tie for 57th.
    

            “It’s just a little bit of an adjustment and something I can work on and something it was good to figure out this week, so I can work on it next week.” 
    

            Kuchar, who has yet to win a major, was delighted after taking home the $1.16 million first prize in front of his wife and two children.
    

            “It’s such an amazing feeling, this stuff never gets old,” the 34-year-old Ryder Cup player said after his sixth PGA Tour victory.  “To win this and have Jack Nicklaus congratulate me is a real treat.”

            It had all been going so smoothly for 

    

            Bogey-free with only three holes to play of a soggy 
 third round on Saturday, the Canadian had looked poised to take a solo lead into the final day before disaster struck.
    

            A bizarre double bogey at the 16th hole saw the world No. 29 – seeking to become just the second Canadian to lift a men’s golf major trophy – leapfrogged by four-time major champion 

    

            The American continued his charge towards a third PGA Championship with his second successive, round-best, four-under 66 to jump to six-under overall and take a one stroke lead into Sunday’s closing round ahead of Conners and Norway’s Viktor Hovland.
    

            Conners and Hovland both shot an even 70 to stay neck-and-neck having begun Saturday with a share of the lead. Scottie Scheffler had made it a three-way split at the summit but saw his pursuit of a second major falter with a frustrating 3-over 73.
    

            The American world No. 2 will start the final round level with England’s Justin Rose, in a tie for fifth place and four shots back of Koepka. The duo are one shot behind the leader’s fellow LIV Golf competitor Bryson DeChambeau, who carded 70 to maintain his hold of solo fourth.
    

            Rory McIlroy kept his name in the picture by shooting his second consecutive 69. The Northern Irishman is the seventh and final golfer with an overall score under par, as another day of miserable conditions contributed to plenty of high scores across the field.
    

            Some casualties included last month’s Masters champion Jon Rahm, 
 as he dropped further out of contention to six-over par overall. Caught in the worst of the rainy conditions, the Spaniard did well to salvage a bogey-spotted start to his third round but will start Sunday 12 shots off the lead.
    

      
      

      

    

            By contrast, the fairytale continued for the adopted hero of Oak Hill: club pro Michael Block. As the only PGA Head Professional to make the cut, the 46-year-old shot his third consecutive even-par 70 to end the day in tied-eighth with American Justin Suh.
    

            It sees Block just one shot behind four-time major champion McIlroy and well ahead of a long list of seasoned winners, including Collin Morikawa, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, and Rahm. In the 105-year history of the major, no PGA Professional has ever finished inside the top-10.
    

            With 13 pars and two birdies under his belt, Conners looked a decent bet to escape unscathed when his tee drive on the par-four 16th found a bunker to the right of the fairway.
    

            Yet the 31-year-old found himself in a nightmare scenario when his subsequent shot slammed into the lip of the bunker with his ball wedged so deep in the rough that a rules official was called to evaluate the situation.
    

            “I saw everybody looking up in the air, I did that as well. I thought it maybe skipped up,” Conners told reporters.
    

            “But didn’t see anything land and was pretty certain it was embedded there. The ball was below my feet and I didn’t quite adjust for that. Wish I could have that one back.”
    

            After a long discussion, Conners was afforded a drop outside the bunker, but further trouble ensued when a poor follow-up shot left him over 80 feet short of the hole having already taken four strokes.
    

            The Canadian scrambled well for a double bogey and eased home with two pars, but a mere two errant swings inflicted damage on his bid to emulate compatriot Mike Weir’s Masters win in 2003.
    

            His fellow countryman’s win had inspired an 11-year-old Conners to pursue a pro career. Now two decades on, Conners has a fighting chance to make his own history.
    

      
      

      

    

            “It would mean a lot to me and I’m sure a lot to people across Canada,” he said.
    

            “I will be playing hard tomorrow, but I’m trying to have some fun out there.”
    

            Another stellar round saw Koepka move closer to ending his four year wait for a fifth major title.
    

            Multiple injuries have contributed to the 33-year-old’s struggles to recapture the form that saw him scoop back-to-back US Open and PGA Championship titles across an unprecedented stretch between 2017 and 2019.
    

            Yet after a runner-up finish at The Masters last month, Koepka looks to be returning to his dominant best. Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods are the only two players to have won at least three PGA Championships in the stroke play era of the tournament.
    

            “I think a major championship would mean a lot to anybody,” he told reporters.
    

            “I was just told that I think only Tiger [Woods] and Jack [Nicklaus] have won three, so that would be pretty special to be in a list or category with them. Just got to go out and go play good tomorrow.”
    

            Followed – and occasionally jeered – throughout by big Rochester crowds, that noise can be expected to reach fever-pitch tomorrow. Not that Koepka seems bothered.
    

            “I didn’t hear any good chirps, nothing creative,” he said.
    

            “A lot of it is repetitive honestly. I’m not trying to dog the fans, but I enjoy when they are creative, when there’s something funny that they say. Usually that’s the one that kind of sticks out.”
    

      
      

      

    

            Yet despite the heckles, Koepka wouldn’t have it any other way.
    

            “I love New York, it’s always fun,” Koepka said.
    

            “You do something really well, they are going to let you know, and if you do something pretty poor, they are going to let you know, and I just love that.
    

            “I love when the fans are on you, cheering for you, or you know, giving you crap if you screw up. That’s the beauty of it. You want that, or at least I want that atmosphere.”
    

            Koepka is schedule to tee off with Hovland in the last pairing of Sunday’s final round at 2:30 p.m ET (7:30 p.m. BST), 10 minutes after Conners and DeChambeau.

Manchester City win 2-0 at Newcastle United Sunday
Take over at the top of the English Premier League from Chelsea
Managers in verbal spat after Newcastle goal disallowed
Liverpool win eight-goal thriller at Stoke City

            Managers Manuel Pellegrini and Alan Pardew were involved in an unseemly touchline spat as Manchester City went back to the top of the English Premier League with a controversial 2-0 win at Newcastle Sunday.
    

            Pellegrini’s City had taken an early lead through Edin Dzeko when the verbal confrontation occurred after Newcastle had an apparent equalizer from Cheick Tiote chalked off by referee Mike Jones.
    

            He ruled that Yoan Gouffran, who was in an offside position, was interfering with play, but the decision infuriated Pardew.
    

            He confronted fourth official Martin Atkinson and with the benches from both teams drawn into the argument, Pardew also directed some of his venom in the direction of Chilean Pellegrini.
    

            “Pellegrini said something to me on the touchline which I wasn’t happy with, it was normal banter where I probably used words I shouldn’t have in the heat of the moment and I apologize for that,” admitted Pardew after the match.
    

            

    

            Pardew was given a two-match ban for pushing a referee last season and it remains to be seen what action the English Football Association takes after receiving reports from the officials.  
    

            Pellegrini, who was angered by a foul on Samir Nasri by Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, which saw the French star stretchered off, tried to play down the incident.
    

            “Nothing important was said on the touchline between me and Alan Pardew, but I think it’s impossible for the referee to handle a game when every time he gave a decision against Newcastle there were complaints,” he said.
    

            He has overseen a 16-match unbeaten run for his expensively-assembled side, which has gone a point clear of Chelsea at the top of the EPL.
    

            Arsenal, who play Aston Villa Monday, can reclaim first place with a victory in a tight title race.
    

            Dzeko’s eighth-minute goal and a late strike from Alvaro Negredo in stoppage time sealed the victory.
    

            In between, Joe Hart made some fine saves to deny Yohan Cabaye and Loic Remy as Newcastle pressed for the leveler.
    

            

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            
 later revived their faltering challenge with a pulsating 5-3 victory at Stoke City as Luis Suarez scored twice.
    

            His 32nd-minute strike allied to an earlier own goal from Ryan Shawcross put Liverpool 2-0 ahead until the home side hit back through former Reds duo Peter Crouch and Charlie Adam.
    

            A Steven Gerrard penalty after Raheem Sterling was fouled and Suarez’s second opened up the two-goal cushion again before Jonathan Walters gave Stoke late hope.
    

            Substitute striker Daniel Sturridge, making his return from an ankle injury that had sidelined the England international since late November, snuffed that out with the clinching fifth with Liverpool moving back to fourth, five points adrift of Manchester City.

            Paul Stewart played for the England international team and some of English football’s leading clubs, notably Manchester City, 
 and Liverpool.
    

            It’s a career to be proud of, but Stewart’s memories are often consumed by the horrific daily cruelty he says he suffered between the ages of 11 and 15 as a youth footballer.
    

            Stewart is one of hundreds of 
 dealing with the consequences of childhood sexual abuse that occurred within the game as they strived to become professional players.
    

            This week, Stewart says he’d hoped to find solace in the independent review from prominent lawyer Clive Sheldon, commissioned by the Football Association (FA), into the scandal.
    

            Instead, he says survivors of this sexual abuse have suffered “another kick in the teeth” following the release of a report detailing the “significant institutional failings” from English football’s authorities.
    

            Stewart told CNN that the findings have left victims angry and disappointed when they had sought closure and vindication after decades of life impacted by the painful memories of abuse. 
    

            “This was commissioned by the FA, it was paid for by the FA and we’re going to be disappointed, aren’t we?” Stewart told CNN Sport’s Don Riddell. “They’re not going to completely hold their hands up and be liable for what happened.”
    

            In the review by Sheldon, which was commissioned by the FA in 2016 after several former footballers came forward to discuss their experiences of sex abuse in the game, it was noted that the FA showed “significant institutional failings” in delaying the introduction of “appropriate and sufficient child protection measures” between October 1995 and May 2000.
    

            The report also noted that “there is no evidence that the FA knew that there was a serious or systemic problem of child sexual abuse within the game in England and no evidence that the FA ought to have known there was such a problem” prior to the summer of 1995.
    

            But having spoken to many of the other survivors since the review was published, Stewart says that they reject this conclusion. 
    

            “Prior to ’95, there is no blame on any of the clubs, on any of the establishment because they said that nobody spoke out,” he says.
    

            “Yet these individuals have clearly said that they spoke to coaches, that they spoke to staff at clubs, and the report refuses to validate that – in fact, ignores the fact that they say that. It’s caused a lot of stress on a lot of my colleagues.” 
    

            Stewart says the abuse he suffered as a child – “very, very early on … for a sustained four-year period” – has darkened how he views his outstanding achievements. 
    

            “On paper it looks like I had a really good football career,” he says. “But I didn’t enjoy it. I didn’t enjoy one bit of it. 
    

            “I was so good at putting an act on, looking like I was this successful footballer, but inside I was an empty soul. I was dying and behind closed doors, I was struggling, really, really struggling.”
    

            Contacted by CNN for comment on Stewart and others being disappointed by the report, the FA referred back to its 
 released earlier this week. 
    

            In the statement, Mark Bullingham, chief executive of the FA, said the release of the review was a “dark day for the beautiful game” in which “we must acknowledge the mistakes of the past and ensure that we do everything possible to prevent them being repeated.”
    

            Bullingham added: “I’ve had the privilege of meeting some survivors, whose courage is inspirational and whose stories are incredibly moving. They will never forget what has happened to them, and this report will now ensure the game will never forget either.
    

            “So, today I address the survivors directly, as the people that matter most. To them I say: You have the deepest admiration of the FA. Your bravery throughout this process has been incredible. Your voices have been so powerful.
    

            “I’d like to start by giving a heartfelt apology on behalf of the Football Association and the English game to all survivors, that this happened to you within football. No child should ever have experienced the abuse you did.”
    

            When former Crewe Alexandra player 
 revealed in 2016 that he had been subjected to horrific abuse as a child at the hands of paedophile and football scout 
, it compelled Stewart to speak about his own experience. 
    

            “I knew that having played for some of the biggest clubs in the UK and playing for my country, I knew that the story would then really gain momentum,” says Stewart. 
    

            In regard to the solidarity victims have felt, Stewart says: “I didn’t expect the tsunami of individuals that came forward. I don’t know why I didn’t expect it. But, you know, I was as shocked as everyone when it actually went nationwide and global.
    

            “There were so many young footballers who had suffered the same as I did, and their dream was the same, to be a footballer.”
    

            The accounts of Woodward and Stewart, among others, led the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the FA to set up a hotline for footballers who had experienced sexual abuse. According to The Guardian, it received over 800 calls in the first week.
    

            Before the end of the year, the FA had commissioned the Independent Review into Child Sexual Abuse in Football 1970-2005.
    

            After four years of waiting – further delayed by increased allegations against Woodward’s abuser Bennell, who was jailed in 2018 for 31 years at Liverpool Crown Court for 50 counts of child sexual abuse – the 710-page report was released this week.
    

            “In my judgment,” Sheldon said in the review, “from October 1995 to May 2000, the FA acted far too slowly to introduce appropriate and sufficient child protection measures, and to ensure that safeguarding was taken seriously by those involved in the game. These are significant failings for which there is no excuse.”
    

            The review found that there were at least 240 suspects and 692 survivors of sexual abuse within football as of August 2020.
    

            In Stewart’s time as a young footballer, he says he felt powerless to stop the abuse he suffered as the very person doing the damage oversaw his career’s progression. 
    

            Paedophiles in sport, he says, position themselves as “dream makers” with the ability to fulfil a child’s ambition, giving them an ability to perpetuate the abuse. 
    

            “There are many reasons why you don’t say anything,” Stewart says.
    

            “There were threats that he would kill my parents and kill my brothers, there were the gifts, but I suppose the overriding reason you don’t speak out is because you genuinely believe that that coach has the power in his hands to give and take away the only thing you ever want to be, which for me, was a footballer.
    

            “When I was a child, the worry that this coach had the power to give and take away that dream was why he was able to abuse me for as long as he did. And I think that’s the same in a lot of sports.”
    

            Stewart now works with the English Football League giving safeguarding advice to young players, coaches and their families.
    

            What he says are the only positives he can take from the Sheldon report are 13 recommendations to increase safeguarding in the sport which will add “another layer on top of the safeguarding that’s already there.”
    

            Nevertheless, he worries for the grassroots of the game.
    

            “You have volunteers who are normally in charge of the safeguarding,” he says. “Now, these people have jobs and some of our grassroots football clubs have upwards of 1,500 children, boys and girls. And they may only have one safeguarding officer.
    

            “These people [abusers] operate in these areas, and whilst we have come a long way, we need not sit on our laurels, we need not get complacent.”
    

            

    

            Stewart does admit that football, due to the money in the game, is best placed to implement safeguarding measures for children. Other sports – as has recently been 
 with the 
 of sexual abuse in gymnastics – are also vulnerable.  
    

            In his own journey, Stewart finds comfort in the work he does helping youngsters.
    

            Speaking to CNN, Stewart didn’t name his abuser but has done so in previous interviews.
    

            His abuser died in Manchester in 2005. While his family were devastated as this prevented the chance for retribution, he was determined to move on.
    

            “I’d had 42 years where this abuser had affected my life and I refused to allow it to affect any more,” Stewart says.
    

            “I’m 56 now and in the few years that I may have, I’d like to think that I can find some solace somehow, and I do that by the work that I do with the football league.”
    

            He added: “I wish when I was at Blackpool starting out, that I had somebody that I thought I could go and speak to, I think I would have enjoyed my football career then.”
    

            According to a statement from Blackpool carried by the Blackpool Gazette, the club said it “commends the bravery of those who came forward to share their experiences with Mr Sheldon and his team and the club expresses its sincere sympathy to those who have suffered abuse.”
    

            The English Premier League said that it is “deeply saddened” by the content of the review and that “our thoughts are with all those affected,” while the English Football League said the review “illustrates the devastating impact that child abuse within football has had on survivors and continues to have on their everyday lives.”

            Jockey Luis Saez was disqualified for a rules infraction while riding Maximum Security in the Kentucky Derby.
    

            Now he has been suspended by racing stewards for 15 racing days, according to a document on the

            Saez was suspended “for failure to control his mount and make the proper effort to maintain a straight course thereby causing interference with several rivals that resulted in the disqualification of his mount,” says the letter dated Sunday.
    

            The dates of his suspension are May 23-27, May 30-June 2, June 6-9 and June 13-14.
    

            Sean Deskins, an attorney for the jockey, told CNN that Saez plans to file an appeal, which must be done within 10 days.
    

      
      

      

    

            Maximum Security led the Kentucky Derby on May 4 from wire to wire and crossed the finish line 1 3/4 lengths ahead of Country House but was disqualified for interference while turning for home. Racing stewards decided that Maximum Security impacted the progress of War of Will, which in turn interfered with Long Range Toddy and Bodexpress. Country House was declared the winner.
    

            Barry Stilz, an attorney for Maximum Security’s owner, Gary West, had no comment on Saez’s suspension. Stilz previously told CNN they intend to seek additional legal options after an appeal was denied May 6 by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission.
    

            Neither Maximum Security nor Country House will race in the Preakness Stakes, which is Saturday in Baltimore.

            They are traveling from Los Angeles and Sydney, Buenos Aires and Toronto, Stockholm and London to have their say in a landmark referendum that has divided their country. 
    

            Ireland will vote Friday on whether to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the country’s constitution, which says a mother and her fetus have equal rights to life. 
    

      
      

      

    

            If Yes wins, Ireland is expected to enact legislation that will allow for terminations up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy. A No vote would keep Ireland’s abortion laws – some of the strictest in the European Union – in place. 
    

            Men and women from the Irish diaspora and both sides of the debate have posted about their journeys home on social media under the hashtag #HomeToVote, sharing photos and stories from airports, planes, cars and trains. 
    

            Lauryn Canny, a Yes voter, tweeted a photo of her passport and boarding pass along with another picture of herself wearing a “Repeal” sweatshirt. “I’m coming #HomeToVote ! Will be traveling 5,169 miles from LA to Dublin and will be thinking of every Irish woman who has had to travel to access healthcare that should be available in their own country.”
    
I'm coming 
 ! Will be traveling 5,169 miles from LA to Dublin and will be thinking of every Irish woman who has had to travel to access healthcare that should be available in their own country. Let's do this, Ireland! 
 
 

            Fia, traveling from Toronto, tweeted that she booked her flights home from Toronto “approximately 25 seconds” after the referendum date was announced. “To all of the women who have been, and continue to be affected by the 8th amendment - I’m so sorry. The women of Ireland deserve better,” she wrote. 
    

            Some people, like Alice Murphy, said they were unable to travel but offered to pay for flights home for Irish voters in Britain who were struggling with money. 
    
Irish working in the UK: if there is anyone who can fly home to vote on Friday but doesn’t have the money, please DM me - I will pay for your flights home as I can’t come home myself. 
 
 

            Another Irish voter tweeted how she had forgotten her “Repeal” sweatshirt on her way back from Vietnam, but her parents showed up at Dublin airport with a replacement for her.
    

            Others expressed relief to meet other Irish people on the flight from Buenos Aires.

            The UK-based London-Irish United for Life, a No campaign group, also posted some stories of Irish people going back to vote against changing the law. 
    

            “I support saving the 8th because I don’t want Ireland to mirror the abortion culture in the UK, where babies are aborted for any reason,” said Breda from Donegal in a video tweeted by the group.
    
Breda from Donegal is concerned about Ireland copying Britain’s example. Every year there are roughly 185,000 abortions in England & Wales alone. That’s over twice the capacity of Croke Park.

            Rebecca from Dublin told London-Irish United for Life that she was going home to vote because she thinks “women deserve better than being pitted against their babies. I think babies deserve the right to life, they deserve protection just as anybody else does, and I don’t believe that this is the best thing for women. I think women deserve better than abortions.”

            A British nurse who risked – and ultimately lost – her life to help British and French soldiers escape from German-occupied Belgium in World War I is remembered with a Google Doodle Tuesday. 
    

            Edith Cavell was born on December 4, 1865, in Norfolk, eastern England. Nursing wasn’t an immediate vocation – she turned to it at the age of 30, after caring for her sick father. 
    

            Following training at the Royal London Hospital with Matron Eva Lückes, a friend of Florence Nightingale, she went on to work in a number of UK hospitals before her life changed forever with a move to Belgium. 
    

            There she was appointed the first matron of the Berkendael Institute in Brussels, where she became a pioneer of modern nursing. 
    

            Cavell, who never married, was visiting family in 1914 when war broke out. She immediately returned to Brussels, where she pledged to treat casualties of all nationalities – regardless of their allegiance. 
    

      
      

      

    

            She simultaneously became involved with an underground group that sheltered French and British soldiers. Together, they helped around 200 men to escape occupied Belgium. 
    

            But disaster struck in August 1915 when Cavell was caught, arrested and charged with treason. She confessed to a German military court and was executed on October 12, 1915, despite an international outcry.
    

      
      

      

    

            Two years after her death, the Nation’s Fund for Nurses was launched to assist those who “sought the health of others at the expense of her own.” It was later renamed the Cavell Nurses’ Trust.
    

            Cavell is the latest in a long line of notable women to be honored by Google, among them singer Ella Fitzgerald, actor Audrey Hepburn and pioneering pilot Amelia Earhart.

Initially published in July 2016


            In August 1996, Tiger Woods turned professional and set about changing the game of golf forever.
    

            Over the intervening 20 years, he’s set records on the course and off it with his prodigious talent and immense marketability.
    

            He might not have played competitively since August 2015 after 
, but the former world No.1 – now ranked 898th – is finally set to return this week at the Hero World Challenge, a $3.5 million invitational event hosted by his own foundation.
    

            Woods had 
 to return to action at the October 13-16 Safeway Open, but withdrew from the PGA Tour season-opener after deciding he was “not yet ready to play.”
    

            And, while the 14-time major winner hasn’t been out of the game entirely, taking on the role of US vice-captain at Hazeltine for September’s 
, 17 months of injury turmoil will finally come to an end when he tees off in the Bahamas this Thursday. 
    

            Woods may never reach his previous heights again; aged 40, he’s cast doubt on his lifelong quest to break Jack Nicklaus’ record of 18 major titles.
    

            But, given the Golden Bear won his 16th, 17th and 18th majors after his 40th birthday, a revitalized Tiger certainly has plenty to play for. 
    

            As he prepares to put troubled times behind him, CNN reporters recall the times they met one of history’s most fascinating sportsmen.
    

            

    

            “I have long been a sports fan and followed Woods’ amateur career. When CNN asked me if I would like to meet Tiger and interview him, I jumped at the opportunity. I believed he would likely become the best golfer to ever play the game.
    

            “People were very excited to meet him. There was a buzz on the boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey where this all took place. People knew he was a young man who was likely to make history.
    

            “Woods was polite, thoughtful, and considerate. I remember thinking to myself that I hoped he would always stay that way because I was so certain he would be immensely successful and so many people who become rich and famous don’t keep the values they had when it all began. 
    

            “Tiger clearly knew what he was capable of at a young age. And I also had little doubt about his capabilities. It is amazing now to look back and know that what he, I, and so many others thought would happen did indeed happen. 
    

            “The difference of course is that he was relatively innocent and naive back then. Now, he has the physical and emotional scars that one often gets as the years go by.
    

            “With the benefit of hindsight, I would ask him if he was concerned about the pressures of being on the PGA Tour and his personal life off the tour. I would ask him if he felt he had the support to deal with all of that. 
    

            “And then I wish I said to him that I hope he has a happy and healthy career. I try to be polite when I interview people and I don’t think I got the chance to say that to him as he began his path to fame and fortune.”
    

            

    

            

    

            “I interviewed Tiger five or six times over a three-year period and I felt like we got to know each other pretty well during that time … but it seems like a lifetime ago now. 
    

            “So much has changed, he’s no longer the golfer and athlete who dominated the world and obviously his personal life is totally different.
    

            “For three consecutive years we met in Dubai at the Dubai Desert Classic, always on Wednesday lunchtime after his pro-am round and always in the same elevated location above the lush practice green.
    

            “We used to talk a lot – both on camera and off – about our families and how lucky we were. I think he was genuinely excited to be a Dad and absolutely devastated when his father passed away.
    

            “I’ll always remember his reaction when I told him I had twin boys in 2006 ‘Twins?,’ he exclaimed, ‘Holy s**t!’ 
    

            “I guess my reaction was similar when he hit the fire hydrant in 2009 and everything fell apart; turns out I’d been getting an overly varnished account of his marital bliss.  
    

            “He once told me that he didn’t want to be remembered for his achievements as a golfer, more for his ‘actions as a human being.’
    

            “Hopefully I’ll get to see him again one day. If so, I’d ask what has been the single biggest regret of his life. Whether it’s personal or professional, I think that would be very revealing.” 
    

            

    

            

    

            “It was a whirlwind trip to China for 36 hours. A long way to go, but it was an opportunity to host the first ever sit-down interview with Tiger and Rory McIlroy. Rory had yet to be announced as a Nike player, but the rumors had begun of a multimillion dollar deal. I remember noting that he wore Nike trainers to the interview. 
    

            “That was revealing, but we couldn’t really speak about it, as he was still under contract to his other clothing sponsors. Rory and Tiger had both decided not to compete in the WGC event later that week in Shanghai, which caused a bit of a fuss. 
    

            “They were here in Zhengzhou for a big money match and we were the only television interview that they were doing, so it was a real exclusive. I’d interviewed him once in Dubai for CNN about 18 months previously. 
    

            “I’d also interviewed him after various rounds at the Masters, in my previous role for the BBC. 
    

            “Tiger was very friendly. He arrived early for the interview and came straight over to me. We spoke about his other sporting passion, NFL. 
    

            “He is a great friend of the Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, and they had been beaten a few hours before and he was still smarting at the loss, so we spoke about that and how Romo is also a good golfer. 
    

            “Tiger was very relaxed and very good humored. We were off to a good start and then Rory turned up, also in good form. The two had a very natural friendship and it certainly wasn’t forced. They were laughing and joking. It was clear that they were genuinely friendly. 
    
Can Tiger Woods still break Jack Nickalus's record of 18 majors?

            “It was a good atmosphere. However, it was very noticeable how Tiger changed the minute the red light went on and we began recording the interview. It wasn’t bad or anything, just a very noticeable change in his demeanor as soon as we started. He doesn’t really like interviews. 
    

            “He was lighthearted again once we finished and wished me a safe trip home. I hope to interview Tiger many more times in the future! 
    

            

    

            “I expect him to return to top class golf, and to win again. We have seen the best of him, but there are still a few more chapters left in his extraordinary story, so I hope to be in a position to bring those stories to the CNN audience.”

            France’s World Cup-winning striker Olivier Giroud believes it is “impossible” for a professional footballer to come out as gay.
    

            The Chelsea star, speaking to French newspaper 
, said it is an “understatement” to say the sport is not ready to accept an openly gay player.
    

            

    

            “When I saw the German Thomas Hitzlsperger come out in 2014, it was very emotional,” he said. “That was when I said to myself it’s impossible to display homosexuality in football.”
    

            Hitzlsperger, a former German international, is the most high-profile former footballer to come out, doing so a year after announcing his retirement.
    

            

    

            

    

            There are currently just two openly gay professional players in world football, Minnesota United’s Collin Martin and Sweden’s Anton Hysen.
    

            Justin Fashanu, Britain’s first £1 million black footballer, became the first openly gay professional footballer in 1990.
    

            “In the dressing room, there is a lot of testosterone, teasing and communal showers,” Giroud said. “It is delicate but that is how it is. 
    

            “I can understand the distress and the difficulty for guys to come out – it is a real challenge after working on yourself for years.”
    

            

    

            Giroud has been involved in campaigns while at former clubs Arsenal and at Montpellier, where he appeared on the front cover of gay magazine Tetu, to raise awareness of the issues LGBT people face.
    

            English clubs will again take part in a campaign later this month which will aim to raise awareness of homophobia in football, with rainbow laces, corner flags and captains’ armbands on display at grounds around the country.
    

            “I am ultra tolerant,” Giroud said. “When I was at Montpellier, I was involved in the fight, notably doing the cover of Tetu.
    

            “At Arsenal, when they asked me to wear the rainbow laces in support of the gay community, I did it. There is still a lot of work to do in the world of football on this subject, that’s an understatement.”

            Homily of the Holy Father at the Inauguration of his Papal Ministry
    

            19 March 2013
    

            Dear Brothers and Sisters,
    

                        I thank the Lord that I can celebrate this Holy Mass for the inauguration of my Petrine ministry on the solemnity of Saint Joseph, the spouse of the Virgin Mary and the patron of the universal Church.  It is a significant coincidence, and it is also the name-day of my venerable predecessor: we are close to him with our prayers, full of affection and gratitude.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

                        I offer a warm greeting to my brother cardinals and bishops, the priests, deacons, men and women religious, and all the lay faithful.  I thank the representatives of the other Churches and ecclesial Communities, as well as the representatives of the Jewish community and the other religious communities, for their presence.  My cordial greetings go to the Heads of State and Government, the members of the official Delegations from many countries throughout the world, and the Diplomatic Corps.
    

                        In the Gospel we heard that “Joseph did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took Mary as his wife” (Mt 1:24).  These words already point to the mission which God entrusts to Joseph: he is to be the custos, the protector.  The protector of whom?  Of Mary and Jesus; but this protection is then extended to the Church, as Blessed John Paul II pointed out: “Just as Saint Joseph took loving care of Mary and gladly dedicated himself to Jesus Christ’s upbringing, he likewise watches over and protects Christ’s Mystical Body, the Church, of which the Virgin Mary is the exemplar and model” (Redemptoris Custos, 1).
    

                        How does Joseph exercise his role as protector?  Discreetly, humbly and silently, but with an unfailing presence and utter fidelity, even when he finds it hard to understand.  From the time of his betrothal to Mary until the finding of the twelve-year-old Jesus in the Temple of Jerusalem, he is there at every moment with loving care.  As the spouse of Mary, he is at her side in good times and bad, on the journey to Bethlehem for the census and in the anxious and joyful hours when she gave birth; amid the drama of the flight into Egypt and during the frantic search for their child in the Temple; and later in the day-to-day life of the home of Nazareth, in the workshop where he taught his trade to Jesus.
    

                        How does Joseph respond to his calling to be the protector of Mary, Jesus and the Church?  By being constantly attentive to God, open to the signs of God’s presence and receptive to God’s plans, and not simply to his own.  This is what God asked of David, as we heard in the first reading.  God does not want a house built by men, but faithfulness to his word, to his plan.  It is God himself who builds the house, but from living stones sealed by his Spirit.  Joseph is a “protector” because he is able to hear God’s voice and be guided by his will; and for this reason he is all the more sensitive to the persons entrusted to his safekeeping.  He can look at things realistically, he is in touch with his surroundings, he can make truly wise decisions.  In him, dear friends, we learn how to respond to God’s call, readily and willingly, but we also see the core of the Christian vocation, which is Christ!  Let us protect Christ in our lives, so that we can protect others, so that we can protect creation!
    

                        The vocation of being a “protector”, however, is not just something involving us Christians alone; it also has a prior dimension which is simply human, involving everyone.  It means protecting all creation, the beauty of the created world, as the Book of Genesis tells us and as Saint Francis of Assisi showed us.  It means respecting each of God’s creatures and respecting the environment in which we live. It means protecting people, showing loving concern for each and every person, especially children, the elderly, those in need, who are often the last we think about.  It means caring for one another in our families: husbands and wives first protect one another, and then, as parents, they care for their children, and children themselves, in time, protect their parents.  It means building sincere friendships in which we protect one another in trust, respect, and goodness.  In the end, everything has been entrusted to our protection, and all of us are responsible for it.  Be protectors of God’s gifts!
    

                        Whenever human beings fail to live up to this responsibility, whenever we fail to care for creation and for our brothers and sisters, the way is opened to destruction and hearts are hardened.   Tragically, in every period of history there are “Herods” who plot death, wreak havoc, and mar the countenance of men and women.
    

                        Please, I would like to ask all those who have positions of responsibility in economic, political and social life, and all men and women of goodwill: let us be “protectors” of creation, protectors of God’s plan inscribed in nature, protectors of one another and of the environment.  Let us not allow omens of destruction and death to accompany the advance of this world!  But to be “protectors”, we also have to keep watch over ourselves!  Let us not forget that hatred, envy and pride defile our lives!  Being protectors, then, also means keeping watch over our emotions, over our hearts, because they are the seat of good and evil intentions: intentions that build up and tear down!  We must not be afraid of goodness or even tenderness!
    

                        Here I would add one more thing: caring, protecting, demands goodness, it calls for a certain tenderness.  In the Gospels, Saint Joseph appears as a strong and courageous man, a working man, yet in his heart we see great tenderness, which is not the virtue of the weak but rather a sign of strength of spirit and a capacity for concern, for compassion, for genuine openness to others, for love.  We must not be afraid of goodness, of tenderness!
    

                        Today, together with the feast of Saint Joseph, we are celebrating the beginning of the ministry of the new Bishop of Rome, the Successor of Peter, which also involves a certain power.  Certainly, Jesus Christ conferred power upon Peter, but what sort of power was it?  Jesus’ three questions to Peter about love are followed by three commands: feed my lambs, feed my sheep.  Let us never forget that authentic power is service, and that the Pope too, when exercising power, must enter ever more fully into that service which has its radiant culmination on the Cross.  He must be inspired by the lowly, concrete and faithful service which marked Saint Joseph and, like him, he must open his arms to protect all of God’s people and embrace with tender affection the whole of humanity, especially the poorest, the weakest, the least important, those whom Matthew lists in the final judgment on love: the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick and those in prison (cf. Mt 25:31-46).  Only those who serve with love are able to protect!
    

                        In the second reading, Saint Paul speaks of Abraham, who, “hoping against hope, believed” (Rom 4:18).  Hoping against hope!  Today too, amid so much darkness, we need to see the light of hope and to be men and women who bring hope to others.  To protect creation, to protect every man and every woman, to look upon them with tenderness and love, is to open up a horizon of hope; it is to let a shaft of light break through the heavy clouds; it is to bring the warmth of hope!  For believers, for us Christians, like Abraham, like Saint Joseph, the hope that we bring is set against the horizon of God, which has opened up before us in Christ.  It is a hope built on the rock which is God.
    

                        To protect Jesus with Mary, to protect the whole of creation, to protect each person, especially the poorest, to protect ourselves: this is a service that the Bishop of Rome is called to carry out, yet one to which all of us are called, so that the star of hope will shine brightly.  Let us protect with love all that God has given us!
    

                        I implore the intercession of the Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, Saints Peter and Paul, and Saint Francis, that the Holy Spirit may accompany my ministry, and I ask all of you to pray for me!  Amen.

            The big question continues to loom: Where will Tom Brady play next season?
    

            The New England Patriots quarterback is set to become a free agent, and the speculation is in full effect. Will Brady return to the Patriots, teaming up again with head coach Bill Belichick? Or will Brady – who turns 43 in August – make the move to a new team?
    

            Even his wife Gisele Bundchen doesn’t seem to know.
    

            When asked in a recent question-and-answer session with users on Instagram where Bundchen, who has been married to Brady for 11 years, would be living this year, she responded with a laugh.
    

            “I would love to know where I’m going to be living this year,” she said on an Instagram story. “But I don’t know that yet. Hopefully somewhere nice and wherever my husband is happy playing, so we will see.”
    

            Brady has spent his entire career with the Patriots. In his 20 seasons with New England, Brady has played in nine Super Bowls – winning six, the most of any player – and has won four Super Bowl MVPs and three NFL MVPs.
    

            But could the Brady-and-Belichick combination be coming to an end? According to 
, those close to Brady are being told by the player himself that he’s going elsewhere. However, Darlington continued, those same people don’t necessarily believe that the Patriots won’t try to convince him to stay in a New England uniform.
    

            “We need to wrap our minds around the fact that it is far more likely than not that Tom Brady will not be back with the Patriots,” Darlington said on the ESPN show “Get Up.” He continued by adding: “I am now at the point where I would be stunned if Tom Brady returns to the Patriots.”
    

            NFL Network’s 
 reported that Brady’s agent, Don Yee, was meeting with teams this week at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. Rapoport said that those teams include the Los Angeles Chargers, Las Vegas Raiders, and the Indianapolis Colts. CNN has reached out to Yee for comment but has not heard back.
    

            While agents are not allowed to discuss free agents until March 16, Yee does have other clients, and he can talk to teams about their own players.
    

            The new league year and free agency period begins at 4 p.m. ET on March 18.

            Save the Children has apologized for the past inappropriate behavior of its former chief executive towards female staff, promising a fresh review into the charity’s “organizational culture.”
    

            In a statement Tuesday, the international charity said former CEO Justin Forsyth was investigated twice after complaints from three women about his conduct in 2011 and 2015.
    

            On both occasions, the investigation led to “unreserved” apology from the chief executive and “the matters were closed,” the statement said. 
    

            The Save the Children allegations follow outrage over revelations that staff from British-based charity 
 to engage in sexual acts with the people they were supposed to be helping.
    

      
      

      

    

            According to the BBC, which first reported the claims, Forsyth allegedly sent inappropriate text messages to young female staff about what they were wearing and how he felt about them.
    

            Forsyth left the charity at the end of January 2016 to take up a role as the deputy executive director at UNICEF.
    

            He’s reported to have issued a separate statement Tuesday, saying he had made some “personal mistakes” during his time at Save the Children, and that he had thought “the issue closed many years ago.”
    

            “I recognize that on a few occasions I had unsuitable and thoughtless conversations with colleagues, which I now know caused offense and hurt,”  he said, according to the BBC.
    

      
      

      

    

            UNICEF told CNN it is aware of the reports regarding the “past complaints” about Forsyth. 
    

            In an email, UNICEF spokeswoman Najwa Mekki said, “We welcome Mr. Forsyth’s decision to come forward and acknowledge past mistakes. We are discussing this matter with Mr. Forsyth and his former employer so we can take appropriate action.”
    

            Current Save the Children chief executive Kevin Watkins pledged a “root and branch review” of the charity’s culture to check the safety of staff was being properly protected.
    

            “The review will commence by the end of this week and report in June 2018,” a spokesman for Save the Children said in a statement.
    

            “We apologize for any pain these matters have caused and sincerely hope that the complainants feel able to help us with the review in the coming weeks. This is so that we can better support our skilled and highly valued staff as they help change the lives of millions of children around the world every day.”
    

            In February, Watkins told the House of Commons International Development Committee that sexual exploitation and abuse were a problem

    

            Earlier this week, Oxfam publicly released an internal report compiled in 2011 that details the organization’s investigation into claims staffers had 

    

            The report revealed that, during the investigation, three staff members accused of wrongdoing had “physically threatened and intimidated” a witness.

            The UK charity issued a formal apology to the Haiti government on Monday for their employees’ behavior.
    

            “Oxfam is grateful to the Haiti Government for allowing us the chance now to offer our humblest apologies and to begin explaining ourselves and start the long road ahead of re-establishing trust and partnership, given our 40-year history with Haiti and its citizens,” Simon Ticehurst, Oxfam’s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, said in a statement.

            Luton Town completed one of the most remarkable rises in English football history on Saturday, beating Coventry City on penalties in the 
 to secure a place in the Premier League next season.
    

            The game got off to a worrying start for Luton as talisman defender Tom Lockyer had to be stretchered off after collapsing with nobody near him. Fortunately, the club later announced that he was conscious and had been taken to hospital for assessment.
    

            Jordan Clark broke the deadlock for Luton after 23 minutes with a powerful finish at the near post as the Hatters totally dominated proceedings in the first half.
    

            However, Coventry roared back after halftime and found the equalizer its improved play deserved thanks to Gustavo Hamer’s unerring finish into the bottom corner.
    

            With the scores level after 90 minutes, the match went to extra time as the tension from both ends of a sold out Wembley Stadium became palpable.
    

            As both teams visibly tired during a grueling period of extra time, chances became few and far between and there became a growing sense that this final would be decided on penalties.
    

            Joe Taylor thought he had scored the winning goal for Luton with just five minutes remaining after Jonathan Panzo’s error, but his joy was short-lived as VAR ruled his effort out for handball.
    

            The first 11 penalties in the shootout were as good as you will see at any level, but Coventry’s Fankaty Dabo was the 12th man to step up and, unfortunately, the first to miss as his effort went sailing over the crossbar.
    

            It sent the half of Wembley Stadium that was resplendent in Luton Town orange into delirium, as the Hatters returned to the top flight of English football for the first time in 31 years.
    

            Only 10 years ago Luton was playing in the fifth tier of English football – outside of the Football League – after a brutal 20-year span in which the club suffered five relegations, three administrations and was penalized with 40 total points worth of deductions.
    

            Now, a decade on from the lowest moments in the club’s history, Luton Town will be playing in one of the biggest leagues in the world.
    

            Luton was one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992, having been in the English football’s top flight division the previous season and voted for its organization, but was relegated the season before its introduction.
    

            The club will now receive $211 million (£170 million) across the next three seasons, according to Deloitte’s Sports Business Group, which would increase to $360 million (£290 million) if the club avoids relegation in its first season.
    

            Luton’s stadium, Kenilworth Road, has a capacity of just over 10,000 and is perhaps one of the most unique in English football.
    

            The entry to its Oak Stand is built into a row of houses adjacent to the stadium; it will be quite the sight to watch the likes of Mo Salah and Erling Haaland playing there next season.
    

            Luton reportedly needs to spend around $14.8 million to upgrade one of its stands to meet Premier League safety requirements, but that outlay is now comparatively small change given the promotion payday the club is about to receive.
    

            Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu, Luton’s versatile midfielder, has been with the club since its lowest ebb and has now become the first player in English football history to go from non-league to the Premier League with the same club.
    

            “I feel like I completed football, man,” a beaming Ruddock told Sky Sports after the game. “It’s been a journey. We’ve been through the highs and lows, but you have to believe in yourself and here I am, man.
    

            “I’m a Premier League player … these boys and the fans, I told you were we going to do it and there’s going to be a party all summer in Luton.”

The sports organizations join forces in a ground-breaking marketing partnership
They hope to appeal to an international audience and boost sponsorship
Deal includes shared merchandise sales, advertising space and sports scientists

            The mystery behind the peculiar inscriptions “Out of the Blue” and “True Blue” which first appeared on Sauber engine covers at the Chinese Grand Prix has finally been revealed.
    

            The Swiss Formula One team has joined forces with English football club Chelsea in an innovative marketing ploy aimed at attracting a global audience – and boost sponsorship.
    

            It’s the first such partnership between the sports, and from next week’s Spanish Grand Prix all Sauber cars will be emblazoned with the slogan “Welcome Chelsea FC.”
    

            Chelsea, owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, already has an international fanbase but can now also capitalize on the following of Sauber’s drivers – Mexican Sergio Perez and Kamui Kobayashi of Japan. 
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Likewise, the Sauber logo will soon be plastered on advertising boards at Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge stadium in London and on walls in the club’s interview areas.
    

            The multi-million-dollar organizations will share merchandise sales, advertising space and even sports scientists.
    

            “A partnership like this between Formula One and football has never existed before in this form, yet there are numerous commonalities and possible synergies. In either case we are talking about team sport at the highest – and international – level,” said Sauber chief executive Monisha Kaltenborn.
    

            “The Sauber F1 team and Chelsea FC are dealing with many of the same sporting and commercial topics and we want to strengthen each other in these areas. We are looking forward to exploiting these opportunities.”
    

            F1 fans will get their first live glimpse of the new Sauber C3Is stamped with the Chelsea logo at the Circuit De Catalunya from May 11-13.
    

            “We felt that this Swiss team, the fourth  oldest of the existing teams, reflects our own ideals perfectly,” Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said.
    

        This partnership will benefit us both greatly, with the potential to create unique commercial opportunities
    

            Ron Gourlay, Chelsea FC chief executive
        

            “In a year when Chelsea celebrates 20 seasons as a Premier League team, Sauber does so as a Formula One team. We share many philosophies when it comes to how the respective organizations are run, from the development of young talent to constantly striving for success. 
    

            “Sauber’s philosophy towards grassroots development has produced some of the best drivers in F1, which mirrors our dedication to develop promising young football talent through our academy.
    

            Abramovich has bankrolled Chelsea since buying it in 2003, but the club now has to start paying its own way under European football’s new financial fair play rules.
    

            “This partnership will benefit us both greatly, with the potential to create unique commercial opportunities,” Gourlay said.

Joins seven others to score in 50s on PGA Tour

            He is the hottest player on the PGA Tour, and now Justin Thomas has made history by becoming the youngest player to break 60.
    

            The 23-year-old won the Tournament of Champions on Sunday and backed it up Thursday with a first-round 59 courtesy of an eagle on his last hole at the Sony Open in Hawaii.
    

            The lowest round on the PGA Tour is the 58 of Jim Furyk, recorded at the Travelers Championship last June.

            Two-time major winner Jordan Spieth, a close of friend of Thomas, said after Sunday’s win: “I think it’s potentially floodgates opening for him.

            The charges against Clifford, who has previously said the claims were “totally untrue,” include allegations of sex abuse that date between 1966 and 1985, the police said in a statement.
    

            Clifford has been ordered to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on May 28 to answer the charges. 
    

            Police set up Operation Yewtree to investigate sexual abuse claims after a documentary by broadcaster ITV in October unleashed a flood of allegations against the star, who before that was seen primarily as an eccentric but charismatic man who raised millions of pounds for charity.
    

            The investigation has three strands, one involving claims against just Savile, another involving “Savile and others,” and the third involving only “others.”
    

            The earliest claim against Savile dates back to 1955 and the latest from 2009, when he was in his 80s.
    

            Savile, a popular BBC television personality with his trademark white-blonde hair, was the face of the shows “Top of the Pops” and “Jim’ll Fix It.” He died in 2011.

Video footage appears to show Ahmed H., originally from Syria, trying to make peace between crowd and guards
But authorities say he threw rocks at the police, and he was this week convicted of an ""act of terror""

            Thousands of refugees and migrants, most fleeing violence in the Middle East, mass at the sealed-off border, chanting “Open! Open!” They are desperate to cross into Hungary, but a razor-wire fence, temporary blockade and a line of riot police stand in their way.
    

            As tensions escalate, one voice rises above the fray: A balding, bearded man, wearing a black and white tracksuit top, attempts to negotiate with the officers. “Nobody will make any problem to your country,” he tells the officers at Horgos, near the town of Roszke, using a loudspeaker. “Nobody will make any problem to any policeman. You must understand this – we come here for peace, just to pass.”
    

            As he makes his appeal, the man points into the distance, appearing to indicate that the migrants hope only to pass through the Hungary-Serbia border on their way to other countries in the European Union.
    

            Footage of the incident, recorded by the Hungarian news site 
 in September 2015, shows the man stepping back from the temporary barrier before clashes break out. Migrants can be seen hurling objects at the police and forcing open the border gate. In response, riot police fire tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowd.
    

            The man, identified in court as “Ahmed H.,” was sentenced to 10 years in prison Wednesday for taking part in the riot. 
    

            A court in Szeged, Hungary, this week found him guilty of using violence – throwing rocks – to force police into opening the border, deemed an “act of terror” under Hungarian law. 
    

            It also convicted Ahmed H., a Syrian who lives in Cyprus with his wife and children, of entering Hungary illegally. The 40-year-old is an EU resident and so could have crossed the Hungarian border legally.
    

            He says he was there that day to help his elderly Syrian parents and other relatives, as they navigated their way along the Balkans route from Turkey to Germany. His parents were among a group arrested for allegedly taking part in the rioting. 
    

            “It was heartbreaking to see a man stand and face the wrath of the state,” says Kartik Raj, Amnesty International’s Europe Campaigner. “It’s unthinkable that he deserves 10 years in prison for effectively coming to the aid of his elderly parents and family fleeing Syria.” 
    

            “It’s a sadly predictable result in the context of the Hungarian government’s appalling crackdown on the rights of migrants, twinned with this escalated, ramped up approach to terrorism law,” Raj added.
    

            Amnesty International has called the verdict an “alarming” application of the country’s anti-terrorism laws, which have tightened in recent months.
    

            The case is emblematic of the Hungarian government’s hardline stance on refugees, which has fueled xenophobic sentiment in the nation.
    

            Anna Winogradowna, an activist with the Migrant Solidarity Group of Hungary (Migszol), was among a small group of protesters who demonstrated against Wednesday’s verdict in Szeged.
    

            “All the accusations against Ahmed were trying to conflate his being a Muslim with him being a terrorist,” Winogradowna said. “This connection that they’re making – Islam equates terrorism – that’s very symptomatic of the whole rhetoric in the country.”
    

            Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban has previously said that “every single migrant poses a public security and terror risk.”
    

            Hungary has been heavily criticized for its tough immigration measures since shuttering its border last September. 
    

            In addition to erecting an anti-refugee fence, the country has also criminalized the act of entering Hungary illegally – a law that breaches international asylum treaties and under which Ahmed H. was convicted. Hungary has also started 
 for 3,000 new “border hunters” to patrol the frontier with the police and army.
    

            Orban championed a campaign asking Hungarians to reject EU migrant quotas for the country in a 
 in October. 
    

            A government-financed booklet distributed to Hungarian households as part of the campaign 
 linked migration to increased terrorism. Orban ultimately hailed the country’s referendum as a victory, despite a low voter turnout that rendered its result invalid. 
    

            The Prime Minister’s communications office told CNN in an email: “We do not wish to comment on ongoing cases, only after a final judgment was made,” adding “please remember that it was not the Government but the independent Hungarian judiciary that made this decision based on sound and video recordings as well as testimonies.”
    

            Ahmed H. was captured in photographs and footage by a number of other news agencies on September 16, 2015 – one day after the Hungary-Serbia border was closed. Dozens of police officers, migrants and some journalists were injured in the violence on the same day.
    

            A video filmed by the Kremlin-backed broadcaster 
 shows Ahmed H. shaking his finger at riot police, saying, “No, no,” before violence broke out. 
    

            Other footage, broadcast by 
, shows him standing between police and a crowd of women and children. He can be heard telling reporters: “We want only peace.”
    

            Both the prosecution and defense intend to appeal the verdict. The defense is seeking an acquittal, while the prosecution is hoping for a harsher sentence.  
    

            Speaking at the Hungarian Permanent Conference in Budapest on Thursday, Orban welcomed the conviction.
    

            Referring to a government-sponsored advertising campaign featuring anti-immigrant sentiments, Orban said the message was on the billboard: If you come to Hungary you have to respect our laws, Hungarian news website 444.hu

            “I’m not a celebrity. I’m just Simone Biles, but it’s amazing to be recognized for all of this success for myself and for team USA,” she said. “I’m not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps, I’m the first Simone Biles.
    

            “To me, I’m just the same Simone. I just have two Olympic gold medals now. I feel like I did my job tonight.”

            Manuel recognized the significance of her win after the race.
    

            “It means a lot [to be the first black woman to earn gold in the pool],” Manuel said after the race. “This medal is not just for me. It’s for a whole bunch of people that came before me and have been an inspiration to me. And it’s for all the people after me, who believe they can’t do it.”

            Phelps’ win also created some unusual history too with his 13th gold medal in an individual event. If you go all the way back to the beginning of time, or close to it, there was an ancient Greek who competed in the Olympics – Leonidas of Rhodes. He won 12 individual events for which he was awarded some swanky headgear. 
    

            Phelps, who took his tally to four gold medals at Rio by winning the 200IM for the fourth consecutive Games, moved ahead of Leonidas, who accomplished his feats more than 2,000 years ago.

            On the 189-yard fourth hole the Englishman knocked one right at the flag. It took a few hops after landing on the green and rolled right in the cup.
    

    

            Not that Rose saw it. According to the Los Angeles Times he wasn’t sure what had happened. 
    

            “It was either in or it was off the back edge,” Rose said, the newspaper reported. “And the way the reaction was from the few people around the green, we figured it had gone in.”

            It may be a bloated, over-hyped spectacle, but the Super Bowl usually is good for a memorable moment or two.
    

            Some of them even happen on the field.
    

            From dramatic plays to big blunders to a certain dancing fish, here’s a look back at some of game’s most indelible moments – in no particular order.
    

            Fans had barely returned to their seats for the second half of Super Bowl XLVII when a partial power outage smothered New Orleans’ Superdome in murky dusk.  The Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco 49ers left the field, people had to be rescued from a stalled stadium elevator and fans took to their phones to try and decipher what was going on. Some people joked that Beyonce’s halftime show was so hot it fried the power. Play was stopped for 34 minutes while the electrical glitch was fixed. Many observers think the blackout stalled the Ravens’ momentum and helped the 49ers storm back from a 28-6 deficit to make the game close.
    

            The 1985 Chicago Bears were best known for hard-nosed coach Mike Ditka, star running back Walter Payton, their so-bad-it’s-good “Super Bowl Shuffle” rap video and William Perry, a fun-loving rookie defensive lineman so enormous his nickname was “The Refrigerator.” Late in the Bears’ beatdown of the Patriots in Super Bowl XX, Dikta put The Fridge in the game at running back and watched him barrel into the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown. The stunt amused TV viewers and helped make The Fridge a cult hero.
    

            After a Michael Jackson stunt double faked out the Rose Bowl crowd by popping up atop a large video screen, the King of Pop himself emerged from a stage in the middle of the field. As the crowd cheered and swarmed the stage, Jackson stood frozen in place. And stood. And stood … for a full minute and a half. Finally, he broke into “Bad,” “Billie Jean” and a medley of other hits, kicking off the modern-day tradition of Super Bowl halftime shows by big-name performers. Nobody could pull that introduction off today, though.
    

            It’s one of the most iconic sports moments of the 1960s. Vince Lombardi, coach of the victorious Green Bay Packers, is hoisted off the field on the shoulders of his players at the end of Super Bowl II. Everything about it screams old-school: His suit and tie, the players’ retro helmets, the fact that THEY WERE ACTUALLY CARRYING THEIR COACH OFF THE FIELD (teams don’t do that anymore). It was Lombardi’s last game as the Packers’ coach.
    

            The Raiders were blowing out the Redskins in the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII when TV viewers were startled from their cheese dip by a striking TV commercial. The ad channeled George Orwell’s dystopian novel by featuring a lone female athlete disrupting a drab, conformist society by hurling a hammer at a “Big Brother”-like figure. Let the revolution begin! Directed by Ridley Scott, the iconic spot plugged Apple’s new Macintosh personal computer – “Think Different,” get it? – and signaled the upstart company’s arrival as a major player. It also helped make the Super Bowl an annual showcase for splashy, big-budget commercials.
    

            The game itself was sort of a yawner. But when the Dolphins beat the Washington Redskins, 14-7, in Super Bowl VII, they capped a 17-0 season and became the first NFL team to go undefeated on their way to a championship. Today, 45 years later, they remain the only team to do it. They were snubbed by the White House that year – then-President Richard Nixon was a Redskins fan – but President Obama made up for it by hosting them in 2013.
    

            Patriotism was at a peak during the Persian Gulf War in January 1991 when Whitney Houston stepped to the microphone in Tampa to sing the national anthem. And wow, did she nail it. Houston’s soaring performance brought goose bumps to listeners around the world and was so popular it became a top-20 single, making her the only singer to turn “The Star Spangled Banner” into a pop hit. It was re-released after 9/11, and many consider it the finest version of the national anthem ever.
    

            It may be the greatest play the Super Bowl has ever seen. In the final moments of the game, with the New York Giants trailing 14-10 and facing third down, quarterback Eli Manning twisted away from three Patriots tacklers and heaved a pass downfield to David Tyree. The little-used receiver leaped in the air, wrestled the ball away from a Patriots defender and somehow pinned it to his helmet as he fell to the ground. The Helmet Catch, as it became known, gained 32 yards and instant renown. Four plays later, the Giants scored the winning touchdown, ending the undefeated Patriots’ chance at a perfect season.
    

            Super Bowl XXV ended in agony for Buffalo Bills fans when Scott Norwood barely missed what would have been a game-winning 47-yard field goal in the final seconds. Norwood had hit more than 70% of his kicks that season, but this one sailed just wide to the right. The New York Giants erupted in celebration. The Bills and their fans stood stunned. The defeat marked the first of four consecutive Super Bowl appearances by the Bills – all of them losses. Even today, if you want to make a Buffalo sports fan cringe, just go up to them and whisper, “Scott Norwood.”
    

            Oh, the poor Bills. It was probably a bad omen when Thomas, their star running back, couldn’t find his helmet on the sidelines at the start of the game. The Bills had to run two plays with his backup before Thomas finally found his headgear and dashed onto the field. The miscue personified the Bills’ early-’90s Super Bowl woes and was the beginning of a miserable day for Thomas and his team, who lost 37-24 to the Washington Redskins.
    

            Yes, it was the Nipple Seen ‘Round the World. When Justin Timberlake closed Super Bowl XXXVIII’s halftime show by tearing off part of Janet Jackson’s costume, he did much more than briefly expose her right breast to 140 million people. The “wardrobe malfunction” sparked outrage, spurred an FCC crackdown on “indecency” and became the most TiVo-ed moment ever. Years later, many think the controversy was overblown and unfairly torpedoed Jackson’s career. Timberlake, meanwhile, will be this year’s Super Bowl halftime act.
    

            The Dallas Cowboys were pounding the Bills (yes, them again) 52-17 late in Super Bowl XXVII when Cowboys lineman Leon Lett scooped up a fumble and rumbled, alone and untouched, some 60 yards towards yet another Dallas touchdown. But Lett began showboating as he neared the end zone, allowing Buffalo receiver Don Beebe to catch him and slap the ball from his hand at the one-yard line. The ball bounced into the end zone for a touchback – and a little moral victory for the sad-sack Bills.
    

            With six seconds left in the game and the Tennessee Titans trailing the St. Louis Rams by a touchdown, Titans QB Steve McNair tossed a quick slant pass to receiver Kevin Dyson, who appeared on his way to a game-tying score when he was corralled by Rams linebacker Mike Jones at the 2-yard line. Dyson fell forwards, stretching his right hand – and the ball – towards the end zone as time expired. “Can he get in?” shouted incredulous announcer Al Michaels as the ball hovered inches from the goal line. “No, he cannot!” The Tackle, as it became known, is the most thrilling final play in Super Bowl history.
    

            The rain was coming down in sheets before Prince and his band took the stage in Miami for Super Bowl XLI’s halftime show. It had all the makings of a disaster. Water and electricity don’t mix. Prince’s two backup dancers would be tottering around a slippery stage in 5-inch heels. And yet when the producer asked Prince if he was OK to perform, he responded, “Can you make it rain harder?” Then the pop star went out and killed it, closing with a transcendent version of – what else? – “Purple Rain” as 70,000 fans waved flashlights and the elements raged around him. It was magical, and probably the best Super Bowl halftime show ever.
    

            Nobody gave flamboyant Joe Namath and the upstart New York Jets much of a chance against the mighty Baltimore Colts, who were 18-point favorites. But three days before the game, a tipsy Namath boasted publicly, “We’re gonna win the game. I guarantee it.” It’s the kind of reckless comment that gets pinned up in the opposing team’s locker room and drives coaches crazy. But Namath backed it up, leading the Jets to a 16-7 win and cementing his Broadway Joe legend.
    

            During her 
, pop star Katy Perry rode in on a mechanical lion, dueted with Lenny Kravitz and flew over the stadium crowd on a shooting star. But that’s not what anybody remembers. What they remember is Perry singing “Teenage Dream” against a cartoony tropical backdrop with palm trees, beach balls and two dancers in cuddly shark costumes. To the internet’s great amusement, it soon became clear that the shark to the left of Perry seemed a little … off. While the other shark followed the choreography, Left Shark flailed and spun around and seemed at times to be making it up as he went along. #LeftShark became a meme before halftime was even over.
    

            It’s probably the most-criticized play call in Super Bowl history. Trailing New England 28-24, the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson drove his team to the Patriots’ 1-yard line with 26 seconds left. Since it was only second down and the Seahawks had a timeout left, everyone figured they knew what was coming next: a handoff or two to star running back Marshawn Lynch, who would go full Beast Mode and rumble into the end zone for the win. Instead, Wilson threw a slant pass to Ricardo Lockette that was intercepted by the Patriots’ Malcolm Butler at the goal line. TV announcer Chris Collinsworth spoke for many stunned Seattle fans when he said, “I’m sorry, but I can’t believe the call.”

            A leading cycling boss – Team Ineos sporting director Nicolas Portal – has died at the age of 40.
    

            The Frenchman played a key role in 
 – the cycling outfit then
 following Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s takeover – winning six Tour de France titles between 2013 and 2019.
    

            A statement from the team announced that Portal had died suddenly at his home in Andorra on Tuesday afternoon.
    

            “We are all overcome with grief at this terrible news and would ask everyone to respect the family’s privacy at this difficult time,” the statement 
.
    

            “RIP Nico - your spirit will always be with us on the road and you will forever be in our hearts.”
    

            A former professional cyclist himself, Portal finished his career riding with Team Sky.
    

            He competed six times in the Tour de France, before retiring in 2010 and taking over as Team Ineos’ sporting director in 2013 following Sean Yates’ retirement.
    

            French sports daily L’Equipe reported Portal died of cardiac arrest. When he was a professional cyclist, Portal missed most of the 2009 season because of cardiac arrhythmia.
    

            Under Portal’s stewardship, Chris Froome won the Tour de France four times, Geraint Thomas rode to victory in 2018 before the then 22-year-old Colombian Egan Bernal won last year. 
    

            Froome paid his respects on Twitter, 
: “My thoughts are with Nico’s wife and children tonight. He was the kindest, happiest guy I knew and always lived life to the fullest. Rest In Peace Nico.”

            UK broadcaster Channel 4 has announced that its coverage of the 
 will be fronted by a team consisting entirely of disabled anchors and pundits. 
    

            In what it described as a “global first” for a world-class sporting event, the network’s line-up will include former champions presenting on the ground in China when the games begin next month. 
    

            A daily highlights show will be helmed by Ade Adepitan, an award-winning host and wheelchair basketball player, Channel 4 said in a press release Monday.  
    

      
      

      

    

            Paralympic champion triathlete Lauren Steadman will host the breakfast show alongside quadriplegic former professional rugby player Ed Jackson.
    

            Steadman took home a gold medal victory from the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics and also won silver at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio. 
    

            The presenting line-up also includes recently retired Paralympic swimmer Ellie Robinson, who won gold at the 2016 Rio Games aged just 15. She will be joined by British racing car driver Billy Monger. 
    

            Former sit-skier Sean Rose has been recruited as a pundit, and Channel 4’s overnight sports coverage will be led by Tokyo 2020 presenter Arthur Williams. 
    

            Ian Katz, Channel 4’s director of programs, said in a statement that the move is “testament to the brilliant disabled presenting talent we have in the UK and underlines our commitment to providing opportunities for people with disabilities and making our output truly representative of the entire population.” 
    

      
      

      

    

            Andrew Parsons, the president of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), praised the channel as “a world-leading organization in disability inclusion” that had “improved the broadcast landscape on para sports.” 
    

            He added: “This latest landmark decision is important because representation matters. There are over 15 per cent of persons in Great Britain with a disability and they should be able to switch on a TV and see wonderfully ordinary persons with disabilities like them in front of the camera. This is change starting with sport.”

2018-02-13 18:21:00+00:00,,"Kim wins women's halfpipe gold
At 17 years, 296 days, she is youngest Olympic gold medalist on snow

            Hers is a life changed. 
    

            From 17-year-old standout to Olympic champion.
    

            Standing at 5ft 3in, it is not always easy to spot Chloe Kim in a crowd, but on a cloudless Tuesday in South Korea it was obvious where America’s new golden girl was. 
    

            Kim had already done enough to win the women’s halfpipe gold before she started her final attempt, only to knock it out of the park with a near-perfect score of 98.25. 
    

            At the bottom, she was engulfed in a crowd of reporters and photographers, all competing for her attention over the  relentless clicking of camera shutters, with yells of “Chloe! Chloe! Chloe!,” the shuffling  throng following her every move like ducklings.
    

            Journalists from all around the world wanted to speak to the new Olympic champion. She ran the gauntlet of TV interviews and negotiated the maze of reporters with equanimity. 
    

            

    

            Fans wanted a piece of the action too, craning necks, standing on tip-toe, sticking their smartphones in the air. Any sort of picture would do. 
    

            Such was the madness, minutes before Kim – the youngest female Olympic gold medalist on snow – stood tearfully atop the podium, her mother Boran was pleading to be let through a security check point. 
    

            It was a circus. That is what happens when a teenage sensation fulfills her destiny.
    

            

    

            
 
    

            The first female snowboarder in history to land back-to-back 1080 degree spins in competition aged just 15, the four-time X-Games gold medalist is not an unknown. She is used to being in the spotlight.
    
I hate crying but I'll give myself a pass for this one. Thank you everyone for the love! Stoked to bring home the gold 

            But on a day when the sun’s glare dazzled off the pristine snow, Kim’s star shone as brightly as any of sport’s biggest names. She has entered a whole new world. 
    

            The girl who would climb onto a trampoline each morning before elementary school to practice jumps and flips later admitted she felt like crying before embarking on her thrilling grand finale. 
    

            She even tweeted before her final run that she hadn’t finished her breakfast and was “hangry.”
    

            She performed three spins on the left side, becoming the first female to land consecutive 1080s in the halfpipe at the Olympics. 
    

            Members of Kim’s family whooped and hollered. Overcome with emotion, Kim’s sister could not speak. American flags were raised towards the azure sky. It was spellbinding. 
    

            Her final score of 98.25 was eight-and-a-half points clear of Chinese silver medalist Liu Jiayu.
    

            An hour after her first Olympic gold had been won, the Californian cheerfully sauntered to the press conference, arm around her beaming father. Sharp elbows were needed to capture the moment. 
    

            “There’s not enough of her to go around,” said one journalist. “So aggressive,” muttered another, dismayed at her fellow reporters. 
    

            Red mist nearly descended as a wayward tripod brushed a member of Team USA. Some needed reminding that these were the “Peace” Games. 
    

            Kim, the daughter of South Korean immigrants, dedicated her performance to her grandmother, who still lives in South Korea and was watching her granddaughter compete for the first time. 
    

            “I actually found out during the second run that she was at the bottom and I thought ‘this one’s for you grans.’ I can’t wait to go shopping with her,” Kim told reporters. 
    
🙌 CELEBRATION!!! 🙌
Drinking a cold one after your daughter wins the Gold one. Chloe Kim’s dad, Jong Jin Kim
@chloekimsnow 🇺🇸 🥇 🇰🇷 
 
 

            The weight of expectation lifted, the teenage trailblazer – talented enough but too young to compete under international rules at Sochi four years ago – was relaxed enough to take selfies with compatriot and bronze medalist Arielle Gold before a room full of journalists and pretended to sing into the mic as one of her answers were translated. 
    

            She made peace signs to her father, Jong Jin Kim, who reciprocated from the back of the room, shaking his head and laughing at his daughter’s calm. 
    
Wish I finished my breakfast sandwich but my stubborn self decided not to and now I'm getting hangry

            The pressure had melted away for both of them. 
    

            “I was very stressed because everyone was saying Chloe was going to win gold but no one knows the result – that I cannot control,” he told CNN Sport. 
    

            “Now I’m happy, all the stress is gone. I’m the dad of an Olympic gold medalist, not many people have this kind of feeling.”
    

            

    

            Kim has said she often cries when speaking about her father, the man who is the embodiment of the American Dream, emigrating to the States in 1982 with $800 in cash. He has had a starring role in his daughter’s success. After winning gold, Kim admitted she was unable to fathom “leaving your life behind and chasing this dream with your kid.”
    

            The elder Kim gave up his job so that his youngest daughter’s jaw-dropping talent could blossom.  He would carry her from her bed to the car and drive from La Palma in California to Mammoth Mountain, five-and-a-half hours away. 
    

            “Everybody does hard work for their kid, but I thank my daughter because she achieved the result,” he added. “She’s a good kid. I tell her to be humble, that this is from hard work, that you weren’t born this way.”
    

            Also watching on, amazed by the attention, was Kim’s mum. There has already been an upshot to her daughter’s Olympic feat, she admitted – more Instagram followers.

Erdogan's strategy of wooing Kurdish voters failed

            Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Friday for new parliamentary elections on  November 1 in an effort to break an impasse left by inconclusive elections in June that left no single party with a governing majority.
    

            Erdogan asked Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu on July 9 to form a new government within 45 days. That period will end Sunday.
    

             According to Turkey’s Constitution, when the 45-day period expires without a government being formed, the President can decide to hold a new election.
    

            Erdogan and  his AK Party, or Justice and  Development Party, had hoped to win a two-thirds majority in Parliament to allow them to amend the Constitution and make the President’s position – Erdogan’s position – more powerful.
    

            But his strategy of wooing Kurdish votes by negotiating an end to the long Kurdish insurgency, which has cost an estimated 40,000 lives over the past 30 years, failed. The pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party, or HDP,  did better than the AK Parky expected and won 80 seats, depriving the AK Party of even a majority, never mind the two-thirds percentage for which it had hoped.

She signed seven new sponsorship deals since 2011 French Open win
The world No. 7 has reached two WTA Tour finals this year
She provides Western brands with a direct route into the Chinese marketplace

            You don’t get any prizes for guessing that Maria Sharapova is the highest-earning female athlete in the world.
    

            But who is the second richest? Is it Serena Williams, the American 13-time grand slam winner? Or is it Victoria Azarenka, the world No. 1 and winner of 35 of her 38 matches this year? And away from tennis, there is Danica Patrick, the only woman to win an IndyCar race and a big drawcard for motorsport sponsors.
    

            In fact, it is Li Na, the world No. 7 women’s tennis player and winner of a single grand slam title in a 13-year career.
    

            But that surprise victory at the French Open almost a year ago transformed Li into one of the world’s most marketable athletes.
    

            According to Forbes.com, she earned $18 million to April 2012 (up $10 million from 2011) – $8 million shy of Sharapova’s total but $5 million more than third-placed Williams.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            So why are brands scrambling to associate with Li, who will defend her title at Roland Garros when the clay-court major starts on Sunday.
    

            “Two words: She’s Chinese,” says Simon Chadwick, Professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at Coventry University Business School in Britain.
    

            “Li Na is out there on her own, firstly in terms of being a female Chinese sportsperson and secondly in terms of her international profile and success.”
    

            The fact that Li plays tennis – a traditionally middle-class sport – is also in her favor.
    

            “China has now become the biggest market for luxury brands in the world and there is this kind of convergence between luxury brands and tennis,” Chadwick told CNN.
    

            “The kind of people who are interested in those brands are also interested in tennis, so Li Na is a very convenient way of aligning the two.”
    

            Li’s agent Max Eisenbud, who also represents Sharapova, spotted the potential in 2009 when he signed her to IMG’s books.
    

            He concedes that although he thought she had top-five potential, he didn’t necessarily expect her to be a grand slam winner.
    

            But at age 29, and in her 20th major tournament, Li beat Francesca Schiavone to become the first Chinese player to win a grand slam singles title and set off a chain of events that had Eisenbud working overnight from a makeshift office to stay in touch with his colleagues in Beijing while the offers flooded in.
    

    

            “She’s basically the Billie Jean King of China,” Eisenbud told CNN. “She broke down so many barriers.
    

            “She was the first – and it’s weird that you can say that in 2012 – that there’s somewhere in the world that they just don’t have a rich tradition of sports heroes.
    

            “I think that was very cool to see: that the win was a lot bigger than tennis.”
    

            Li has signed seven new sponsorship deals since her Roland Garros triumph. Among them are luxury car maker Mercedes Benz and Chinese insurance company Taikang Life Insurance Co.
    

            Eisenbud even managed to negotiate a special deal with Nike to allow Li to wear patches on her clothing – something not usually permitted by the American sportswear giant.
    

            “I think we did a good job on a hybrid of global brands that could potentially use Li Na to help get a footing in China and then we also wanted to associate with some great Chinese brands,” he said.
    

            Eisenbud estimates they could have signed up to seven more deals, but with his experience of managing Sharapova’s money-making potential after her 2004 Wimbledon win, he was wary of compromising Li’s tennis career.
    

            Li won only six more matches in 2011 after the French Open final, going out in the second round at Wimbledon and the first hurdle at the U.S. Open.
    

            She has been more like her old self in 2012, reaching two finals, most recently at the Italian Open where she lost out to Sharapova over three sets.
    

            “I liked the way I hit on court,” she said afterwards. “A lot of positive things and I think I am ready for the French Open.”
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            The reality is that financially at least, it really doesn’t matter how Li performs at Roland Garros this time around. She was already nearing the end of her career when she won the title and the deals were negotiated with that in mind.
    

            What IMG and Li’s team has done is what Chadwick calls “short-term harvesting.”
    

            “It’s to make as much money as possible in the period of time they’ve got left before she retires,” said the academic.
    

            “The French Open was all she needed because we’re still talking about it now, that’s proof that’s all she needed.”
    

            Which begs the question: would any Chinese player have had the same earning potential as Li had they become the first major winner from the world’s most populous country?
    

            Maybe not. Chadwick says Li’s added value comes from the fact that she rejected the Chinese state-run sports system, while Eisenbud describes as her “little bit of rebel.”
    

            That little bit of rebelliousness is most visible in the red rose tattoo she sports on her chest.
    

            “In Western terms, marketers talk about brand personality,” Chadwick said. “And she does have some personality to her, the whole thing about her tattoo, the crazy things she says about her husband (who Li has publicly berated for his snoring).”
    

            “Effectively what Li Na does is give these Western brands a direct route into the Chinese marketplace, which is a notoriously difficult and complex country to do business in.”
    

            Li joked in August last year that she still used her husband Jian Shang’s credit card when she went shopping because she liked to save money. If Jian ever needs a loan to pay off the bill, he need look no further than his multimillionaire wife.

 may attract less global attention than in the United States, but it is no less present – and Black Britons say it is past time for the country to face up to its colonial history and act to stamp out racial inequalities.
    

            The police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in Minneapolis sparked global protests over police brutality and racial inequality despite an ongoing pandemic which has had a disproportionate impact on ethnic minorities in the UK and US.

            And an 
 reveals a divided nation, where Black people are twice as likely as White people to say they have not been treated with respect by police. Black people are also about twice as likely as White people to say UK police are institutionally racist – among White people, just over a quarter believe it.
    

            Exposing further division, nearly two in three Black people say the UK has not done enough to address historical racial injustice, twice the proportion of White people who say that.
    

            The CNN poll has been released as the UK marks Windrush Day, introduced in 2018 to celebrate the arrival on June 22, 1948 of the Empire Windrush. The ship carried the first large group of Commonwealth citizens from the Caribbean to Britain – at the invitation of the government – to rebuild the country after World War II.
    

            But the 
 and their children say they continue to suffer as a result of
 by Conservative governments. Some lost their jobs, while others were evicted from their homes or faced deportation after decades living in Britain legally. 
    

            Glenda Caesar, who traveled with her parents from Dominica to Britain as a baby in 1961, says she suddenly lost her job as an administrator with the National Health Service in 2009 as she was unable to provide the necessary documentation. She fell into debt, unable to pay her bills without a wage, and nearly lost her home, she said. 
    

            A decade on, now aged 58, she has been unable to find another job despite being given British citizenship shortly after her plight was highlighted in the media. Her son, who was born in Britain in 1988, was also given citizenship. 
    

            “I was fighting for myself and for my son at the time – that was the thing that hurt me the most,” she told CNN. “Why should I have to fight for his right to be in this country when he was born here?”
    

            Caesar, who spoke at protests this month in the east London neighborhood of Hackney where she lives and the Essex town of Southend, has, however, been heartened by the number, diversity and youth of the demonstrators she’s seen.
    

            “I think it’s good for the world because now people are understanding what us, as a community, what we’ve been saying for a very long time. Where we haven’t had the justice that we’ve always been searching for but now everybody has come together,” she said.
    
“I think it’s good for the world because now people are understanding what us, as a community, what we’ve been saying for a very long time.”

            She thinks others are now ready to stand up for what they believe in. “If we see a young Black man being surrounded by police and they are arresting him, people are now stepping forward and asking what’s going on,” she said. “If we turn our backs it could be another George Floyd and I think we’ve had enough. I feel safe – semi-safe – with my grandchildren growing up because at least I feel people will be looking after them.”
    

            But she is less positive about the outcome for her and others caught up in the Windrush scandal, saying “we are still waiting” to be properly compensated despite the government apologizing for its actions.
    

            She was offered a payout of a little over £22,000 ($27,200) in December under the government’s Windrush Compensation Scheme but – despite her continued difficult financial circumstances – turned it down as she felt it was insultingly low.
    

            “So far 12,000 people have been given documentation to confirm their status, more compensation payments are being made every week and in the case of Ms. Caesar we are working with her representatives to review and resolve her claim,” a Home Office spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. 
    

            “The Home Secretary has been clear that the mistreatment of the Windrush generation by successive governments was completely unacceptable and she will right those wrongs.”
    

            CNN’s poll found that

. CNN has sought comment from the Conservative Party and the government on the poll results.
    

            Policing has long been the sharpest focal point for concerns over racial injustice in the UK. The 
 Macpherson inquiry in 1999, into the botched investigation of the murder of Black teenager Stephen Lawrence, who was killed in a racist attack by White youths in 1993, found that London’s Metropolitan Police was “institutionally racist.” The current Met Police Commissioner, Cressida Dick, insisted in 2019 that the “toxic” label no longer applied to the force.
    

            But despite changes sparked by the Lawrence case and landmark Macpherson inquiry, Black people and other ethnic minorities in Britain are still 
 represented when it comes to police checks (known as stop and search), imprisonment, and deaths in custody. ​
    

            
, ​between April 2018 and March 2019, ​White people were subjected to stop and search at a rate of 4 per 1,000, compared to ​Black people who were stopped and searched at a rate of 38 per 1,000.
    

            Black Britons say their own experiences, and those of others in their communities, highlight disparities in treatment and fuel distrust.
    

            Five Black British friends gained global fame after a picture of one of them 
 from the middle of the crush of a violent London protest went viral. Clashes broke out as 
targeted Black Lives Matter demonstrations. The White man was later 
. 
    

            Patrick Hutchinson, the Black man who carried him from the scene, said he helped the injured demonstrator because he did not want the main message of the protests to be overshadowed by one moment of violence.
    

            In an interview some days later, he told CNN he believed the police to be institutionally racist. 
    

            “There may be individuals within the system who are trying to do a good job but as a collective they are racist,” he said.
    

            Pierre Noah, another of the five friends, said the situation with regards to policing in Britain was “a mess” and that everyone, from the top down to the grassroots, needed to be educated on the issue.
    

            “Do we feel protected by police? Not at all. I don’t think the police are quite sure how to approach our community,” he said. “They haven’t been educated enough how to deal with us in the community.”
    

            “From when I was young to the kids now, honestly, from my heart, every day I pray for them. It’s gone backwards. It’s worse and it shouldn’t be the case.”
    
“It’s gone backwards. It’s worse and it shouldn’t be the case.”

            Asked what he thought the police see when they look at him, Hutchinson replied: “Color, race. Color – first thing they notice and that should be the last thing they notice.”
    

            In response to the protests, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised a review of racial inequality in Britain. But critics say he could instead implement the recommendations made in numerous past reports going back decades.
    

            Opposition Labour Party politician David Lammy, who published a 
of racial inequality in the criminal justice system in 2017, told Johnson he “needs to stop the dither and the delay,” tweeting, “Young and old, black and white, rich and poor, the country is crying out for action.” 
    

            Nurse and 
 Neomi Bennett, from London, was awarded the British Empire Medal for services to nursing in 2018 and met with the Prime Minister in January this year. But she too says she has been impacted by her encounters with Britain’s justice system.
    

            The Guardian newspaper 
 Thursday how police officers approached Bennett one night in April 2019 in southwest London as she was in her car, saying her front windows were tinted too dark. She says she was too intimidated and scared to get out of the vehicle as repeatedly instructed. After several minutes of increasingly heated exchanges, she was pulled from the car and ended up under arrest and in a police cell overnight.
    

            Bennett, 47, was found guilty in September of resisting and obstructing the police, but her conviction was overturned last month after she lodged an appeal which was not contested. She now intends to pursue a civil claim against the Metropolitan Police for wrongful arrest, among other charges.
    

            “I think that the police approached me because they saw a couple of Black people sitting in a car. I believe I was racially profiled,” she told CNN.
    

            A Metropolitan Police statement said the force had received a number of complaints relating to this incident, one of which remained under assessment.
    

            “A complaint regarding discriminatory behavior, incivility, neglect of duty and use of force found no case to answer for. The complainant appealed this decision via the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) and they decided the appeal was not upheld. Due to the current complaint, we cannot go into any more detail at this time.”
    

            Bennett said seeing what happened to George Floyd had pushed her to go public despite the acute embarrassment she says she feels about her own experience.
    

            “When I watched that, I was in tears, I was beside myself, because it was so reminiscent of that time in the cell, the power that the authorities have got,” she said. 
    

            “As a Black woman in this country, if you say ‘it’s a race thing’ or if you say ‘it’s because I’m Black’ you are instantly shut down and told you have a chip on your shoulder. When this happened, it was too clear.”
    
“It seems like for a Black person in the UK, life is constant fighting. There are so many barriers, if you want to achieve anything you have to fight.”

            Her grandparents were part of the Windrush generation, arriving in Britain from Jamaica in the 1960s to give their family greater opportunities. 
    

            “I am so grateful for that and I’ve never taken my Britishness for granted,” she said. “I’m proud to be British, but to be constantly faced with these microaggressions and then spend the night in a cell, it was like ‘I cannot keep it to myself anymore.’”
    

            Bennett also worries for her two sons, one 24 and the other 29, both of whom have recently been stopped by police, she said.
    

            The nurse, who suffered racial abuse while growing up in London, hopes the protests will mark a pivotal moment. “It just feels like the racism has reached a tipping point in regards to the injustices that we are seeing play out before us in front of our eyes,” she said.
    

            “It seems like for a Black person in the UK, life is constant fighting. There are so many barriers, if you want to achieve anything you have to fight.”
    

            So what does Britain need to do to change? 
    

            CNN’s poll has shown how sharply the nation is divided along race lines, whether it comes to policing, representation or history.
    

            Protesters’ demands for statues commemorating people who profited from the slave trade to be toppled have highlighted a wider issue: that too little is done to educate many Britons about their nation’s colonial past.
    

            CNN’s polling found 
 of those statues as White people.
    

            “I don’t believe we should have slave owners looking over us because that’s why we are in this position right now. Why would we idolize slave owners?” Caesar said.
    

            “We need to start putting Black history on the curriculum so children who are growing up don’t need to ask us awkward questions. They already know about the Tudors and so on – they need to know about our history as well.” She believes more training for police on the subject would improve relations too. 
    

            Many believe there also needs to be greater representation of minorities in the cultural environment shaping people’s everyday lives.
    

            Black people are more than twice as likely as White people to say there is too little representation of Black people in film and television, according to CNN’s poll, with two-thirds of Black people saying that and a quarter of White people.
    

            Filmmaker 
, who was born in Barbados and moved to Britain at the age of five, said the current moment could give new energy to those calling for greater representation but cautioned that previous initiatives over the four decades he has spent in the industry had resulted in little change.
    

    

            Shabazz, whose 1981 debut “Burning an Illusion” was only the second feature film by a Black director produced in the UK, encountered so many obstacles in finding funding for other film and TV projects that for years he turned his focus elsewhere, including establishing 
. 
    

            He believes there is too little diversity in senior ranks, which helps perpetuate racial stereotypes, such as portraying young Black men in relation to crime.
    

            Shabazz spoke to CNN from Harare, Zimbabwe, where the 66-year-old now plans to spend more time than in England. 
    

            “It’s a signature of my tiredness at having to keep fighting, having these battles and having to get these things done, and when your vision and your world isn’t seen as important or significant,” he said of the move.
    

            “The way in which the media presents Black people informs the wider society, and it then plays out in day-to-day situations with Black men in particular – women too, of course, but Black men are at the front end in so many ways. You have to look at what is in the media, what is the education narrative that’s in schools, in terms of colonial empire. It’s a sense that our story has no value, so we can then be manipulated and ignored – and the Windrush scandal is another example of that scenario.”
    

            Piers Harrison-Reid, a nurse and performance poet based in the east of England, wrote a poem for CNN to mark this moment.
    

            “And if we aren’t heard with a knee, or with a raised fist, how else can we resist?
    

            “I think the greatest trick racism ever pulled, was convincing England it doesn’t exist.”

            While the dark red might provide 
 with its most famous livery, when it comes to recent performances, even 
 admits they’ve been a bit off color.
    

            “Because our performance of last year [was] so poor, when you’re starting from that point, I think you cannot be confident on how eventually you are competitive in 2021,” Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto recently told 
 Amanda Davies.
    

            It’s a brutal analysis that won’t immediately instill confidence in Ferrari fans after the team’s worst year in Formula One since 1980. 
    

            Binotto oversaw an eighth and 13th finish in the drivers’ championship standings and a sixth finish in the constructors’ championship in 2020, which was a dramatic regression for the historic Italian team and prompted a large-scale internal restructuring. 
    

            In a sport where year-on-year progress is demanded, the lack of results and dip in performances also focused scrutiny on Binotto and Ferrari’s drivers, notably 
 
    

            For 2021, Carlos Sainz has replaced Vettel, joining Charles Leclerc in the famous red racing suits.
    

            Ferrari had a relatively successful season in 2019 – there were 19 podiums finishes and three wins between its two drivers – with budding superstar Leclerc and four-time world champion Vettel at the helm, reducing the gap to Lewis Hamilton and the Mercedes cars.
    

            However, despite Leclerc’s brilliant second place finish in the season-opening Austrian Grand Prix in 2020, Ferrari’s season quickly stalled as its car struggled with speed on the straight lines, both with power and drag.
    

            Binotto pulls no punches when describing last year as a “big, big disappointment,” one which they “cannot repeat,” though he hopes Ferrari can be at least “competitive” from the first race in Bahrain, which is on March 28.
    

            Although the new token system means that parts of the car design has been frozen – postponing any possible development until 2022 – Ferrari have played their tokens on improving the back of the car. 
    

            The token system imposed for this season means teams can choose where to spend development resources, but they are limited to only two tokens to improve certain areas of the car, while other areas are “frozen” and cannot be upgraded. 
    

            While Binotto thinks the car will be better than last year’s edition, he and the two Ferrari drivers admit they won’t know for certain how much of a step forward they have made until all the teams race in Bahrain. 
    

            While the car is a work in progress, Binotto is urging the team to control its mentality and their “will to win.” 
    

            Managing a team with such a storied history – they have won the most world championships – the Ferrari team principal says he feels the “responsibility” of being at the helm, rather than any pressure. 
    

            “Being aware of each single detail counts and I think determination will be again important and showing progress,” said Binotto. 
    

            “So I think it’s really a matter of mentality, team mentality, drivers’ mentality and as team principal, no doubt, I’m fully aware of the responsibility I’ve got being part of such a team. 
    

            “I think it’s Italian excellence in a word. So I feel not the pressure; I feel the responsibility, but as well the pride. We simply need to do better.”
    

            

    

            When Vettel and Ferrari teamed up in 2014, the return of world championships to Italy was the target.
    

            Vettel came close, but since 2018, he fell away dramatically with his younger, Monegasque colleague Leclerc taking the mantle as Ferrari’s No. 1 driver. 
    

            Midway through 2020, it was announced Vettel would be replaced by Sainz. And although it hasn’t been a typical preparation period because of the coronavirus pandemic for the Spaniard, seeing his number on the distinctive red car and pulling on those famous red overalls during preseason training at Maranello has been “special” for Sainz
    

            Despite the arrival of Sainz – one of F1’s promising prospects – much expectation rests on Leclerc’s shoulders. 
    

            The 23-year-old, who joined Ferrari in 2019, struggled like Vettel last season, finishing on the podium just twice. 
    

            Racing for a team steeped in so much F1 history might weigh on the shoulders of some drivers, but not Leclerc, who tries “not think about it too much, because I think this will hurt my performance.”
    

            “At the end, I know what it means to be a Ferrari driver,” said Leclerc. “It’s something very, very special that I’ve dreamed of all my life.
    

            “But on the other hand, I know also that to achieve the best result for the team, I need to focus on my own job and that’s how I will perform at my best.”
    

            The relationship between two drivers in a F1 team is often an intriguing dynamic, as they both compete for the highest finishes, while also working together to prevent their competitors from finishing ahead of them. 
    

            However, the balance between wanting to beat your teammate and doing what’s best for the team can be a hard one to navigate, and one which has historically put drivers on a number of teams into sticky situations. 
    

            Sainz is coming to Ferrari from McLaren where he had a near telepathic relationship with teammate Lando Norris. And although they’ve not been able to spend as much time together on or off the track as they would’ve liked with Covid restrictions, Sainz and Leclerc can both see a strong connection building. 
    

            Sainz says he hopes they can bond over a game of padel – the racquet sport which is popular in Spain after being imported from Mexico, here it was founded in 1969.
    

            Both drivers are well aware that the main priority heading into the new season is the team.  
    

            “I think we are both going to push flat out to make sure we can help this team to move forward,” Sainz said.
    

            “I think we’ve already started on the right foot. We are getting on well and we are having a good relationship … We’ve been working together with this team, trying to push the team forward, trying to push in the same direction.”
    

            

    

            Ferrari’s internal reorganization now sees four heads reporting to Binotto, including Enrico Cardile on the chassis side, Enrico Gualtieri for the power unit, Laurent Mekies for racing and Gianmaria Fulgenzi for the supply chain.
    

            The need to be “dynamic” is key, according to Binotto. 
    

            “Organization has to adapt to what are the challenges and certainly we are always facing new challenges,” he explained. 
    

            “I think that now we’ve got certainly more clarity as well more responsibilities.”
    

            While Ferrari remains realistic that challenging Hamilton will be tough, the importance of returning to the top table is key, not only for this season, but for the future as they aim to create a “winning cycle.” 
    

            Even so, Binotto acknowledges there are no quick fixes – or “silver bullets” as he calls them – which is why this year is a year for setting foundations. 
    

            “I think being Ferrari, I think I suppose we’ve got such a responsibility. We know Ferrari represents Italian excellence in the world,” he said
    

            

    

            “Ferrari somehow is the most winning team in Formula One, it’s the one that has participated since the very start. So I think that’s part of our DNA. And I think if you’re Ferrari, you are always aiming to the title. 
    

            “So we know that it will take some more time, but whatever time it will take, [it is] more important that we cannot as Ferrari simply accept to be there and participate. That cannot be the final objective. And for us it’s not only about winning a title; I think it’s really trying to create a winning cycle.”

World No. 1 unveils court in his name

            If the 
 so far took place on the pristine green courts of Wimbledon, the world No. 1 owes much of his success to the rugged, red clay of Barcelona.
    

            With too few facilities, opportunities and opponents in his native Scotland, a gangly 15-year-old Murray arrived at the Sanchez-Casal Academy in Spain in a bid to boost his career prospects.
    

            According to the academy’s co-founder – three-time doubles grand slam winner Sergio Casal – less than 1% of the kids that he takes on will go on to become a professional.
    

            Despite the odds being stacked against each and every pupil at the academy, Casal says he knew Murray was different from the start.
    

      
      

      

    

            “You could see that he was great,” Casal told CNN, while also revealing that a shy Murray would often have to be found in his living quarters and brought to the practice court.
    

            “Especially as a junior when he started to play a little bit better and some of the pros were coming here. I remember (Carlos) Moya and (Guillermo) Coria came to practice before the Australian Open.”
    

            Casal recalls the two players, both clay-court specialists, would ask him for a junior to practice against and he decided to send Murray.
    

            “After one or two sets, he (Murray) was even winning the set. Okay, the other guys were relaxing a little bit but after losing one set 6-4, the next day it would be 7-5 for him.
    

            

    

            

    

            

    

            

    

            “So that made me think. As a junior, when you play against a professional guy and adapt so quickly to the new game, to the speed of the other play, it looks like they are going to make it.”
    

            This week, ahead of the Barcelona Open, Murray returned to the academy that nurtured him for the unveiling of a tennis court in his name.
    

      
      

      

    

            In a speech given to a few fortunate enough to be present, Murray praised the values the academy and its school instilled in him.
    

            “I had an amazing time here, I loved it,” the three-time grand slam champion said ahead of his last 16 match against Feliciano Lopez Thursday.
    

            “It taught me a lot. I learned to work hard, I learned about discipline and I did my schooling here as well. It was great.
    

            “I never expected to get to number one in the world or do anything that I did. I was just trying to become a professional tennis player, I wanted to get to the top 100 in the world and make a living from playing tennis.
    

            “But it happened and a lot of it started here.”
    

            Built in 1998, the Sanchez-Casal Academy boasts some of the most impressive facilities in the world. 
    

            The 27 tennis courts, the on-site school, physiotherapy center, doctor and gym mean pupils have their every need catered for right on their doorstep.
    

      
      

      

    

            But enrolling in one of Spain’s most well-known tennis academies comes at a cost, with parents spending up to $4,500 per month on their child’s training.
    

            However, former world No. 2 Alex Corretja believes the facility, a melting pot of around 35 different nationalities, is worth the price – if players are willing to give their all.
    

            “If you come here, you know it’s going to be painful, this is going to be hard,” he told CNN. “People think: ‘Oh tennis, it’s just a yellow ball.’ Not everybody can survive. 
    

            “A lot of players get exhausted mentally. It’s not like you’re going to be ready in one or two years.
    

            “If you’re not willing to pay the price to be a very good player, then you better think about other things.”

Grant Elliott hits a six in the final over to seal Kiwi victory in front of Auckland crowd
South Africa had posted a total of 281 in a rain affected match
New Zealand will face either Australia or India in the final on March 29

            New Zealand are on course for a first ever World Cup title after a thrilling semifinal victory over South Africa, secured off the penultimate ball of the match.
    

            Chasing an adjusted target of 298 in just 43 overs after a rain interrupted the match at Eden Park, Grant Elliott hit a six right at the death to confirm victory and send the Auckland crowd into raptures.
    

            It is the first time New Zealand has ever reached a World Cup final, and it will play either Australia or India on Sunday. Te pair face each other in Sydney on Thursday.
    

            Not the first time in the sport, rain played a part. South Africa were motoring with the bat before a two-hour delay for poor weather.
    

            Though its total was escalated by the Duckworth/Lewis method – used to calculate a revised target in the event of a rain delay – New Zealand held firm thanks to Elliott.
    

            His 84 not out underpinned its innings and it was fitting that he delivered the final blow, smashing Dale Steyn for six off the second last ball to spark jubilant scenes at Eden Park.
    

            “I don’t think this win is for myself or the team, but everyone here,” Elliott said at the post-match presentation. “The supporters have been amazing. 
    

            “I think we timed the pace of the innings to perfection. I wasn’t as calm as I looked. When you have 45,000 fans screaming at you every ball… 
    

            “It has been an absolute pleasure playing in front of this crowd. We have had a good run. It is the first final we have been in as New Zealand. 
    

            “We are a very level team, we will approach it as any other game. Nothing going in my mind when I hit the six. I don’t even know where the ball went.”
    
WHAT A SHOT! Grant Elliott seals the win with SIX over Long-On, amazing scenes in Eden Park! 
 
 

            South Africa, who themselves have never reached the final, have been accused of choking in past installments of the one-day competition.
    

            But that indictment cannot be leveled at it after one of the most dramatic matches in World Cup history. 
    

            It had recovered from 114-3 in the 27th over to 216-3 after 38 overs thanks to some fierce hitting from captain AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis, before the rain came.
    

            With the game stopped for two hours, it finally reached 281 off its reduced 43 overs, du Plessis top scoring with 82.
    

            New Zealand’s target was upgraded via Duckworth/Lewis, a calculation that takes into account how many overs were left and how many wickets had been lost, to 298.
    
What a game of cricket in NZ, please hold your heads high South Africa, you've done everyone proud as you gave it absolutely everything !! 👍

            Kiwi skipper Brendan McCullum got it off to a fast start with a 22-ball half-century but after he was dismissed it wobbled, and needed 139 from 22 overs.
    

            But Elliott was the steadying hand, judging his innings perfectly. 
    

            And though he was dropped in the penultimate over, he struck the telling blow off Steyn to seal victory and inflict a fourth semifinal defeat on South Africa.
    

            “It was a great advertisement for cricket,” McCullum said at the post-match presentation. “Everybody involved will remember this for the rest of their lives. 
    

            “What a great innings from Grant. He came out of wilderness not long ago. The greatest time of our lives. We have enjoyed the experience.
    

            “I hope the crowds are all dreaming the way we are. Gee it would be nice to win it. We don’t mind whom we face in the final. 
    

            “They are both quality sides, but we know if we play the way we want to we are a good chance.”
    

            Should Australia beat India at the Sydney Cricket Ground, then the joint hosts of the World Cup will meet in the final in Melbourne.
    

            “It was an amazing game of cricket,” AB de Villiers said. “Probably the most electric crowd I have ever heard in my life. I guess the best team has come out on top. We gave it our best. No regrets. 
    

            “We left it all out there. It is hurting. It is going to take a while to recover. The bigger picture is for the people back home. We play for them. I hope they can still be proud of us.”

They are raising money for breast cancer and veterans charities

            They spent nine months on a boat, rowing two-hour shifts all day, seven days a week, without a toilet and with only an hour-and-a-half nap at a time.

            In one of their last blog posts, the members of the Coxless Crew team said they were focused only on the final 20 miles.

            “They were very worried about if they would overshoot Samoa, (or) they would run out of food,” she said. “There were a lot of concerns on that second leg. … There’s been no shortage of drama on this journey.”

Galatasaray leading 2-1 when the match was abandoned in stoppage time
Fans hurled objects, including chairs, during clashes with riot police
Violent scenes began following a red card for Galatasaray's Felipe Melo

            A derby match between Besiktas and Galatasaray in the Turkish city of Istanbul was abandoned on Sunday as one of Europe’s most fiercely contested football rivalries descended into violence and chaos.

            “The Eagles’ Turkish Super League game against Galatasaray at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium was suspended by the referee in injury time,” read a statement on Besiktas’ official website.

            The far-right deputy mayor of Hitler’s birthplace has resigned after writing a “deeply racist” poem comparing migrants to rats, which sparked fury across Austria and condemnation from Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.
    

            Christian Schilcher, a member of the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPÖ) that forms half of the country’s ruling alliance, had published the poem in the Easter edition of his party’s regional newspaper.
    

            It used xenophobic imagery to suggest that migrants should assimilate or “quickly hurry away” from their adopted countries, and was written over a drawing of a rat wearing a long black beard and hat.
    

      
      

      

    

            One line reads: “if you mix two cultures … it’s as if you destroy them.”
    

            “Just as we live down here, so must other rats, who as guests or migrants … share with us the way of life, or … quickly hurry away,” the poem also says. Its title roughly translates to “The City Rat (Rodent from the Sewer).”
    

            Schilcher served as the deputy mayor of the small town of Braunau am Inn before his resignation was announced on Tuesday, reported by
.
    

            He had initially defended the message of the poem, claiming in 
 with regional newspaper Oberösterreichische Nachrichten that he had not considered the historical connotations of the comparison between humans and rats.
    

            Comparing Jewish people to rodents was a tactic frequently used in Nazi German propaganda under Adolf Hitler, who was born in Braunau am Inn.
    
Das ist doch alles nicht normal! Die 
 mit einem „Ostergruß“ und einem „Gedicht“ namens „Die Stadtratte - Nagetier mit Kanalisationshintergrund!“ Diese niederträchtige, menschenverachtende Partei sitzt in der Regierung und der Kanzler schweigt und schweigt und schweigt... 

            Chancellor Kurz – who has previously come under pressure to denounce the rhetoric and actions of FPÖ politicians – welcomed Schilcher’s resignation, after initially condemning the poem.
    

            “The resignation of the vice mayor #Braunau of was the only logical consequence of this vile and racist poem,” he wrote on Twitter, calling the move “necessary and correct.”
    

            Kurz has attempted to curb criticism over his ties with the far right party, as he prepares to contest next month’s European elections. The FPÖ has been in government with Kurz’s Austrian People’s Party since the country’s 2017 election, in which both parties took a hard line against immigration.
    

            “The choice of words is disgusting, shows contempt for human beings and is deeply racist,” he told 
 after the poem had first been discovered.
    

            “The Freedom Party in Upper Austria must distance themselves from this immediately and unequivocally and issue a clarification,” he added.
    

            The poem was published on the same day as Heinz-Christian Strache, FPÖ chairman and Austria’s vice chancellor, was accused of sharing an article from a website that denies the Holocaust – putting further pressure on Kurz to distance himself from the party as he prepares to contest next month’s European elections.

I felt a real responsibility to be the first one to go to college, and the first one to be successful. 
    

            I grew up very fast, I took things very seriously. I graduated high school at 16 and went to college, determined to be an attorney.  I also got engaged very young, at 19. 
    

            But when I was in my last semester of senior year of college I realized I was leading someone else’s life and I wasn’t really recognizing things that were inside me that were really important.  Creativity and curiosity and really experiencing things.

            Early on I was told I could do anything I wanted to do. It wasn’t an issue being a woman or not coming from a wealthy family, and that is what always inspired me. 
    

            

    

            
How was it perceived when you first joined HSN in 2006? 
    

            
 It was definitely an interesting time. I spent the first 18 years of my career in the menswear industry. When I started polo jeans, which was my startup experience, and then I went to Nike, so those were somewhat difference transitions. 
    

            When it was announced that I was leaving Nike, to go to what at the time was called IAC retail, it wasn’t exactly looked at as aspirational. 
    

            
 But why was it so attractive to you?
    

            
 Because I had seen the world changing. I had the opportunity to be traveling globally, to Japan to China, Latin America.  I saw the wave of growth of mobile interaction in Japan that wasn’t even glistening here at that time. 
    

            How people were interfacing with brands. How technology was going to change things, how content was becoming power.  So I knew that there was something there and I thought this could be part of it.
    

            I was at home watching HSN, keeping an eye on the competition but I’m also food network lover. I remember my husband saying “what are you doing” and I said “I’m trying to see what’s gonna click”.  
    

            All of a sudden I saw Wolfgang Puck – who was engaging and entertaining and he wasn’t selling. He was inspiring and engaging customers and they wanted to buy his product because of that. The next day I went and had lunch with Chairman Barry Diller at the Four Seasons and kind of laid out this vision.  
    

        I believe that the reason that I really understand our consumer is I AM her. 
    

            MIndy Grossman, CEO of HSNi
        

            And what’s wonderful, in pure Barry fashion he was like, go forth.  And you know - I jumped in.
    

            
 Do you shop at HSN? 
    

            
 I’m going to tell you the truth. My husband once burst out laughing and I said what’s so funny.  He said you just got a letter from yourself for being one of the best customers at HSN! 
    

            
 How much do you buy?
    

            
 I think I might be one of, if not the biggest jewelry customers. 
    

            I believe that the reason that I really understand our consumer is I AM her. I love the thrill of it, I love discovery, I love the story behind what I’m buying. You can walk with me in my home and I will tell you the story of where I found that chair and how I found that chair and every single piece. 
    

            

    

            
 Part of the reason for your success has been you attracting major celebrities and their brands and bringing them to HSN.  Why has it done so well? 
    

            
 One of the things that we said early on is if we’re going to have credibility in this idea of editorial program commerce, we need every one of the individuals that come to HSN, they have to have a great product, a great story and be a great storyteller. 
    

            It’s about the story, so if you look at our recent 100 Foot Journey or Maleficent with our Disney partnership, those are things that can transport people they can feel they’re part of that journey and then they can be inspired to want the product, and that’s what we’re trying to do.
    

            

    

            
  What are some of the challenges you’ve faced in your time here? 
    

            
 The challenge was getting people to embrace the new, and dealing with being dismissed. It hurts because you take it personally, but it makes you stronger.  
    

            I’ll never forget when I first went to some fancy cocktail party in New York, somebody said asked what I did, and I said i was the CEO of IAC retail and we have HSN, and they go (whispering) “I’ve shopped on HSN” and I go, “Why are you whispering?!” But it was a very sobering experience and one that really, reinforced my belief of how to behave, as a leader as an individual.

            A growing number of female British lawmakers have quit ahead of the 
, with some citing vicious 
 and intimidation as reasons for stepping down.
    

            In total, six female politicians have resigned since Monday because of the difficulties of being an MP, personal circumstances, or due to threats. 
    

            The exodus comes after a 
. 
    

            Culture secretary and Conservative MP Nicky Morgan was the latest to resign on Wednesday evening, saying that the “the clear impact on my family and the other sacrifices involved in, and the abuse for, doing the job as a modern MP” were behind her decision. 
    

      
      

      

    

            Liberal Democrat MP Heidi Allen also wrote in a letter on Tuesday that she would be standing down ahead of the election because she is “exhausted by the invasion into my privacy and the nastiness and intimidation that has become commonplace.”
    

            “Nobody in any job should have to put up with threats, aggressive emails, being shouted at in the street, sworn at on social media, or have to install panic alarms at home.”

, who said it had become “normal” for British politicians to take extra security measures to feel safe while doing their jobs in a heavily polarized political climate.
    

            British politicians say they’ve received an unprecedented number of threatening messages since the UK’s vote to
 in 2016.
    

            One man who harassed Allen by sharing aerial images and detailed information about her home to what she said was his “hard Brexit, right-wing network” was 
. However his effect on Allen’s life remained even after he was imprisoned, when she installed permanent panic buttons, security lights and industrial locks around her home.
    

            MPs face abuse on social media in person for their stances on Brexit, and women on the front line of British politics have experienced an unnerving level of abuse – ranging from harassment to 
.
    

            Caroline Spelman and Mims Davies are two other female Conservatives who announced they were standing down.
    

      
      

      

    

            On Thursday Spelman 
 in the UK that it’s “not surprising that so many good female colleagues have decided to stand down at this election” after the prevalence of “sexually charged rhetoric” on social media, “with threats to rape us and referring to us by our genitalia.”
    

            She said “female candidates are deterred” from entering the political sphere as a result.
    

            There are also a number of senior male Conservative MPs who are standing down ahead of the December 12 election. They include Jo Johnson, the Prime Minister’s brother; Ken Clarke, the longest serving member of Parliament; and veteran Alistair Burt.
    

            Earlier this year, London Metropolitan Police chief Cressida Dick 
 that officers had seen a “very considerable rise” in the number of threats received by MPs and that statistics showed crimes had doubled from 151 in 2017 to 341 in 2018.
    

            Those targeted disproportionately are 
 (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) MPs – across the political spectrum. Among those abused the most is Labour’s Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott, who was the UK’s first female black lawmaker.
    

            A report by Amnesty International found that ahead of the 2017 election, 45% of abusive tweets were aimed at her and amounted to an average of 51 abusive tweets a day.
    

            “It’s the volume of it which makes it so debilitating, so corrosive and so upsetting,” Abbott told Amnesty. She added that the kind of abuse she receives makes “younger women of color very hesitant about entering the public debate and thinking about going in politics.”

Bred for racing, she was sold to a US Marine for $250 in 1952
Reckless credited with saving lives of soldiers during Korean War

            When a horse senses danger, its instincts tell it to run away as fast as possible. 
    

            But during the 1950-53 Korean War, one mare would run towards it: Staff Sergeant Reckless, the only horse in US history to have been promoted to the rank of sergeant.
    

            Bought for $250 in 1952 by a US marine corps lieutenant at Seoul Race Track from a young Korean boy who needed the cash to buy his sister an artificial leg, the small horse would become America’s greatest war horse.
    

            Although she was bred as a racehorse, she was part Jeju, a local breed known for its hardiness. That toughness served her well when she became a pack animal trained to carry ammunition for the Anti-Tank Company of the 5th Marines in 1952. 
    

            The marines called her Reckless, after the recoilless rifle for which she carried ammunition. The cannon was often dubbed the “reckless” rifle because it was so dangerous to handle. 
    
Staff Sergeant Reckless (right) with her primary trainer, Platoon Gunnery Sergeant Joseph Latham. Reckless earned several awards and decora… 

            “Reckless was all alone when she joined the Marines,” Robin Hutton wrote in her 2014 book “Sgt. Reckless. America’s War Horse.” 
    

            “Because horses are ‘herd’ animals, the Marines became her herd. She bonded so deeply with them that Reckless would go anywhere and do anything to help her adopted family.” 
    

            Reckless played an important role during the Battle of Outpost Vegas in the final stages of the Korean War between US and Chinese armed forces in March 1953.
    

            During this five-day bloody battle, which is estimated to have cost the lives of 1,000 American and 2,000 Chinese soldiers, Reckless made 51 trips to resupply the guns with ammunition on one day alone. 
    

      
      

      

    

            All in all, the small mare carried 386 rounds of ammunition, weighing almost 4,000 kilograms, by walking more than 35 miles through rice paddies and steep mountain trails. After unloading the ammunition, Reckless would carry the wounded soldiers back down to safety, despite getting injured twice herself.  
    

            Astonishingly, Reckless did all of this mostly by herself whilst being under heavy enemy fire. She was trained to lie down when under fire and to avoid obstacles such as barbed wire.
    

            “She was a critical lifeline to the guns that were firing in support of us,” Sgt. Harold E. Wadley of the US Marine Corps, who served with Reckless during the Korean War, wrote in a foreword to Hutton’s book.
    

            At times, the Marines would use their own flak jackets to cover their comrade from incoming fire.
    
Sergeant Reckless delivered ammo to the recoilless rifle platoon’s firing sites. She would be led a few times and then could make the trip to and from the ammo dump by herself. During just one battle, she made 51 trips under enemy fire, most of them by herself, carrying a to… 

            “Reckless was a very special horse and undoubtedly bonded through a spiritual connection of love with her Marines,” said Wadley. 
    

            “The noise and waves of concussion can’t be described, but she endured it all,” said Wadley. “I believe an angel had to be riding Reckless, since she was alone and without a marine to lead her.” 
    

            Reckless, who would sleep in the soldiers’ tents at night, also endeared herself to her fellow Marines in a different way.
    

            “Reckless had a voracious appetite,” Hutton, who is also president of the Sgt. Reckless Memorial Fund, wrote on a website dedicated to the horse. “She would eat anything and everything – but especially scrambled eggs and pancakes in the morning with her morning cup of coffee. 
    

            “She also loved cake, Hershey bars, candy from the C rations, and Coca Cola – even poker chips, blankets and hats when she was being ignored – or if she was trying to just prove a point.” 
    

            Reckless also enjoyed the occasional beer with her fellow Marines.
    

            

    

            

    

            Reckless, whose military decorations included two Purple Hearts, received a hero’s welcome when she was shipped from Korea to the US in 1954, with hundreds of people awaiting her arrival in San Francisco. 
    

            Having twice been promoted to staff sergeant, Reckless would spend the rest of her life at Camp Pendleton in California, where she gave birth to one filly and three colts, according to History.com. 
    

            Although her death in 1968 was front page news in the US, and she was buried with full military honors, the horse had become somewhat of a forgotten hero in the decades that followed. 
    

            But in recent years, the legend of Reckless has been resurrected, with a number of books being published and statues being unveiled at Virginia’s National Museum of the Marine Corps and Heritage Center in 2013 and at Camp Pendleton in 2016.
    

            Last weekend, on the 50th anniversary of her death in Camp Pendleton at the age of 20, a 1,000-pound bronze statue of Reckless was unveiled at Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington by four Korean War veterans—including Wadley, who served with her.
    
The support for the Sergeant Reckless Monument at the Kentucky Horse Park has almost been reached, but we still need your help! Watch this video for more information about this incredible mare, and how you can be involved in honoring her legacy. 
 

            And perhaps fittingly given how she started life on a race track under the Korean name Flame of the Morning, her statue now stands alongside sculptures of racing legends Secretariat, winner of the 1973 Triple Crown, and 1920s champion Man o’War. 
    

            

    

            “Horse really run from chaos,” Hutton told local Kentucky broacaster WHAS11. “But Reckless ran towards the chaos.”

Another pro-independence party, Candidatura d'Unitat Popular, won 10 seats
But the pro-independence parties, between them, failed to win an overall majority of the votes cast

            A pro-independence alliance has won a majority of seats in the Spanish region of Catalonia, plunging 
 into a constitutional crisis just two months ahead of national elections. 
    

            With nearly all votes counted Sunday, the Junts Pel Si (Together For Yes) alliance won 62 seats in the 135-member regional parliament, and another pro-independence party, Candidatura d’Unitat Popular (CUP), won 10 seats.
    

            But the pro-independence parties between them failed to win an overall majority of the votes cast, ending up with just under 48%.
    

            The turnout – at 77% of just over 5 million eligible voters – was the highest in Catalan elections since Spain became a democracy in the 1970s. 
    

            Artur Mas, president of the Catalonian government, told a rally in Barcelona as the results came in: “Today we have a double victory. The yes vote has won, and what’s more democracy has won.”
    

            Junts Pel Si pledged before the vote that if it won a majority in the assembly it would begin an 18-month process toward a unilateral declaration of independence for Catalonia, Spain’s richest region.
    

            But there’s no guarantee Mas will be able to attract the leftist CUP into a formal coalition. The leader of the CUP, Antonio Banos, has been critical of Junts Pel Si and of Mas.
    

            “The president of Catalonia has to be a leader by consensus, and Mas is not,” Banos said last week.
    

            The failure of the pro-independence parties to win an absolute majority of votes cast may restrain them from pressing forward immediately with unilateral moves toward independence, a process fraught with political and economic risks.
    

            The European Union has said an independent Catalonia would have to apply for membership. Several European leaders, including British Prime Minister David Cameron, have spoken in favor of Spain remaining united. And during a visit to the United States by King Felipe of Spain earlier this month, President Obama said the United States was “deeply committed to maintaining a relationship with a strong and unified Spain.”
    

            Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who leads the conservative Popular Party, has said secession by Catalonia would be unconstitutional. He told a rally last week that Catalonia needed a new face of normalcy, after three sets of elections there in five years. And he accused the pro-independence parties of doing nothing but promoting tension, uncertainty and division.
    

            “What would happen with financial institutions, what would happen with bank deposits, to the currency?” he asked in a radio interview.
    

            Catalonia, which includes Barcelona, has long complained that its revenues subsidize other parts of Spain. It includes some 16% of the Spanish population and much of Spain’s manufacturing and finance sectors.
    

            The vote in Catalonia will complicate parties’ calculations ahead of the general election, due early in December.
    

            Polls suggest that no party will command a majority in the vote and analysts expect tough bargaining on forming a new coalition. To be viable, such a coalition may even need support from one of the Catalan parties.
    

            Antonio Roldan Mones of the political risk group Eurasia, predicts: “The first thing the new government in Madrid will do following parliamentary elections is start a negotiation to reform the balance of powers among Spain’s regions, probably involving a constitutional reform.”
    

            The opposition Socialists in Madrid have indicated that they may support constitutional changes.
    

            Spanish regions already have considerable power in healthcare, education and tax collection, but the wealthier areas believe complex mechanisms for redistributing tax revenue are unfair. Even so, any further amendment to the constitution would open up a litany of grievances.

U.S. justice officials accuse these 7 arrested in New York of drug trafficking
The raids zero in on the Calabrian mafia, the 'Ndrangheta; 17 arrested in Italy
It is the first such joint crackdown on ties between mafia families in the United States and Italy

            Members of the powerful Gambino and Bonanno crime families were among 24 people arrested Tuesday in New York and several cities in Italy in a major anti-mafia raid, authorities said.
    

            The FBI and Italian police carried
out the raid as part of operation “New Bridge,” which targeted more than 40 people for international drug trafficking and organized crime in connection with the ‘Ndrangheta mafia, officials added.
    

            Italian police arrested 17 suspects, anti-mafia prosecutor Franco Roberti told reporters at a news conference in Rome. 
    

            The FBI arrested seven people in New York in a coordinated raid, he added, including members of the Gambino and Bonanno families.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            The U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Eastern District of New York named these seven suspects as ‘Ndrangheta member Raffaele Valente, also known as “Lello,” Gambino associate Franco Lupoi, Bonanno associate Charles Centaro, also known as “Charlie Pepsi,” Dominic Ali, Alexander Chan, Christos Fasarakis, and Jose Alfredo Garcia, also known as “Freddy.”
    

            The defendants are charged with drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms offenses, “based, in part, on their participation in a transnational heroin and cocaine trafficking conspiracy involving the ‘Ndrangheta, one of Italy’s most powerful organized crime syndicates,” it said.
    

            All seven pleaded not guilty Tuesday to the various charges in a federal court in Brooklyn.
    

            Afterward, four of the men – Valente, Lupoi, Chan and Garcia – were held without bail, though bail could become an option later. In addition to the drug and money laundering charges, Valente and Lupoi are also charged with selling an unregistered firearm silencer.
    

            Meanwhile, Centaro, Fasarakis and Ali all were free on bail. In addition to surrendering their passports, their travel within the United States is limited as well. Ali’s bond was $1.4 million bond, and bond was $1 million for the other two.
    

            Investigators speaking at the news conference in Rome said the money found in the raids amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
    

            The operations in Italy were carried out
in the southern region of Calabria, home of the ‘Ndrangheta syndicate, and in the cities of Naples, Caserta, Torino, Benevento and Catanzaro. The Italian mafia family involved in the alliance, or “bridge,” with the Gambino family, is called Ursino Ionica.
    

            Tuesday’s operation was the first ever jointly run by U.S. and Italian police targeting the ties between the two countries’ ‘Ndrangheta mafia families, investigators said.
    

            Anti-mafia prosecutors in Calabria have been carrying out an investigation over the past two years, and Italian police compiled a 2,000-page report detailing what was learned, including information from phone wiretaps.
    

            

    

            The Italian national anti-mafia body, which coordinated the investigation and operation, alleges that the ‘Ndrangheta is behind a ring of drug trafficking between South and Central America, Canada, the United States and Italy.
    

            U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said the operation had “dealt a lasting blow” to the ‘Ndrangheta’s efforts to gain a foothold in New York.
    

            “The ‘Ndrangheta is an exceptionally dangerous, sophisticated and insidious criminal organization, with tentacles stretching from Italy to countries around the world,” she said.
    

            “The defendant Lupoi sought to use his connections with both ‘Ndrangheta and the Gambino crime family to extend his own criminal reach literally around the globe.”
    

            Together, the accused sought to move cocaine and heroin into the United States under the guise of legitimate shipping operations, with the help of a corrupt official at the port of Gioia Tauro, in Calabria, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.
    

            Lupoi, from Brooklyn, has lived in Calabria and used his connections with both the Gambino organized crime family and the ‘Ndrangheta to pursue international criminal activity, it said.
    

            Among those arrested in Italy are his father-in-law, Antonio Simonetta, and his cousin, Francesco Ursino, it said.
    

            During two joint FBI-Italian operations in Italy, Lupoi and Ursino sold more than 1.3 kilograms of heroin to an FBI undercover agent for what they believed was eventual distribution in the United States, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. 
    

            In New York, Lupoi, Chan and Garcia sold the undercover agent more than a kilogram of heroin, it added.
    

            

    

            Lupoi, 44, is also accused of plotting to smuggle 500 kilograms of cocaine, concealed in frozen food, in shipping containers from Guyana, in South America, to Calabria, thanks to connections with Mexican drug cartels operating in Guyana.
    

            Italian court documents show the conspiracy slowed after shipping containers from a Guyanese shipping company were seized in Malaysia and found to contain more than $7 million in cocaine hidden in cans labeled as containing coconut milk and pineapple, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.  
    

            Investigators said at the news conference that the Mexico-Calabria connection was established in New York. 
    

            Law enforcement officials are still trying to establish how the drug traveled from Mexico to Guyana but said that some of the suspects took trips to Latin America following their New York meetings.
    

            The illegal traffic of drugs between the United States and Italy stopped by police could have earned the mafia millions of euros, authorities said, though they declined to give an exact figure.
    

            Raffaele Grassi, head of the Criminal Unit of the Italian State Police, told reporters that the operation demonstrated that the “‘Ndrangheta is one of the strongest organizations in the world in illegal drug trade.” 
    

            He cited its sophisticated network of contacts and its ability to adapt and find new markets, including “expanding beyond Italian borders.”
    

            

    

            Grassi said that historically, the Gambino family had had ties with the Sicilian Mafia, Cosa Nostra. But their involvement in the illegal traffic of heroin, known as the “Pizza Connection,” was dismantled or severely curtailed in the 1980s, he said, and they are now trading mainly cocaine.
    

            The latest operation, according to Grassi and FBI officials, shows that the mafia families of the “new continent” are still seeking and relying on “old country” connections – which is why investigators dubbed the operation “New Bridge.”
    

            According to Grassi, the Italian-American mafia families “need this new bridge to connect and support the traffic of cocaine.”
    

            While the existence of a connection between the Calabrian mafia and U.S. mafia families has been well known, Tuesday’s operation shows its great strength and reach, investigators said.
    

            One of the more alarming discoveries to emerge from the operation was evidence that ‘Ndrangheta has also reached out to the Far East in the heroin trade, another investigator said.

            The death of former NFL player Vincent Jackson was due to “chronic alcohol use,” according to his autopsy.
    

            The Hillsborough County, Florida, medical examiner’s report, released this week, shows that Jackson’s death in February was considered “natural” and the cause was listed as “chronic alcohol use.”
    

      
      

      

    

            Jackson, who was 38 when he died earlier this year, played for the then-San Diego Chargers and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during his career. 
.
    

            He was found dead in a hotel room on February 15 in Brandon, Florida, with no apparent signs of trauma, officials said at the time. His family had reported him missing less than a week prior, CNN reported.
    

            “Vincent Jackson was a brilliant, disciplined, gentle giant whose life began to change in his mid-30s. He became depressed, with progressive memory loss, problem solving difficulties, paranoia, and eventually extreme social isolation,” said Dr. Ann McKee, chief of neuropathology for the VA Boston Healthcare System and director of the BU CTE Center and VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank. 
    

            CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease caused by repetitive head trauma, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. Stage 2 CTE, which can only be diagnosed through an autopsy, is associated with 
 like aggression, impulsivity, depression, anxiety, paranoia, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation, along with progressive cognitive symptoms, according to the foundation.

 was secretly taped during a phone call with one of his cardinals, it emerged during an on-going financial trial at the 
 on Thursday.
    

            A Vatican court heard the audio recording between Pope Francis and Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a defendant in the trial, in which the Cardinal asks the Pope to confirm that he had authorized payments to help free a kidnapped nun in Africa. 
    

            Journalists were not allowed to listen to the recording but a transcript from the Italian Financial Police was subsequently published by Italian news agency Adnkronos. Three defense lawyers at the trial also later confirmed the contents of the conversation to Vatican journalists present. 
    

            The recording was made by a third party in the room with Cardinal Becciu during the phone conversation, which took place on July 24, 2021. The call occurred three days before the beginning of the Vatican trial in which Becciu is accused of embezzlement and abuse of office, and just 10 days after Francis was released from hospital for intestinal surgery.
    

            In the call, Becciu asks the Pope to confirm that he had authorized the payments which the Cardinal made to a self-described security consultant named Cecilia Marogna – who is also charged with embezzlement in the trial – to in turn pay the British firm, Inkerman Group, to help secure the release of the nun who had been kidnapped by Islamic militants in Mali in 2017, the transcript states.
    

            The amounts paid, according to Cardinal Becciu, who was at the time the number two at the Vatican’s Secretariat of State, were 350,000 euros ($363,706 USD) to the British firm and 500,000 euros ($519,580 USD) in ransom for the nun.
    

            According to the transcript, the Pope said on the call that he vaguely remembered and asks the cardinal to put in writing what he would like the Pope to confirm.
    

            Under Vatican law there is no provision for a Pope to be called as a witness in a trial.
    

            Cardinal Becciu, who was fired from his job and stripped of most of his rights as cardinal by Pope Francis in September 2020, has always maintained that any financial transactions he undertook were fully approved of by his superiors, including Pope Francis. Becciu and Marogna have both pleaded not guilty to all charges in the trial.
    

            A statement from Becciu’s lawyers sent to CNN on Thursday did not comment on the secretly recorded phone call. 
    

            Revelations of a secretly taped phone call and what Pope Francis knew about the Vatican’s financial transactions are just the latest in a long and complicated trial which centers on the Vatican’s purchase of a luxury building in London in which 10 defendants are accused of fraud and extortion.

            The Brexit process was thrown into disarray Monday as Prime Minister Theresa May pulled the plug on a crucial parliamentary vote on her deal for the country to leave the European Union.
    

            May admitted the decision to delay the vote was made after it became clear she would lose it “by a significant margin.” She will now go back to EU leaders to seek further reassurances, she said.  
    

            The embattled leader told the UK House of Commons that she had listened “very carefully to what has been said in this chamber and out of it” – a statement that was met with laughter and jeering by members of Parliament.
    

            An emergency debate on the government’s decision will take place in Parliament on Tuesday morning as “the first item of business,” Speaker John Bercow said. Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn requested the emergency debate Monday night. 
    

      
      

      

    

            May admitted that “there remains widespread and deep concern” over the Northern Ireland backstop. The backstop is an arrangement designed to ensure there is no return to a “hard border” between Ireland, which will remain part of the European Union after Brexit, and Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the bloc next March.
    

            Northern Ireland’s secretary of state said she supported the decision to delay the vote. 
    

            “Clearly, having listened to colleagues across the House, there is more work to be done to provide reassurances on the Northern Ireland-Ireland backstop,” MP Karen Bradley said in a statement. “I am convinced that leaving the EU without an agreement would be disastrous for Northern Ireland and potentially for the long-term future of the Union. I am not prepared to take risks with or gamble the Union of the United Kingdom.”
    

            The prime minister said she had hoped changes secured to the backstop, to avoid being trapped in it indefinitely, would be enough for MPs.
    

            “I spoke to a number of EU leaders over the weekend and, in advance of the European Council, I will go to see my counterparts in other member states and the leadership of the council and the commission. I will discuss with them the clear concerns that this House has expressed,” May said.
    

            “We will therefore defer the vote scheduled for tomorrow and not proceed to divide the House at this time,” May added. 
    

            On Tuesday morning May will travel to The Hague to hold a bilateral meeting with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Downing Street said.
    

            It will be part of May’s plan to seek “assurances” from EU leaders, which she can then convey to the UK Parliament to pass her Brexit deal.
    

            Corbyn called her agreement a “botched deal” before adding that “our country deserves better than this.”
    

            “The government has lost control of events and is in complete disarray,” Corbyn said. “It’s been evident for weeks that the prime minister’s deal did not have confidence of this House yet she plowed on regardless, reiterating ‘this is the only deal available.’”
    

            The leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, confirmed the vote was no longer on the House voting schedule after May’s statement. 
    

            The uncertainty over the future of Brexit caused sterling to plummet Monday to its weakest level in a year-and-a-half.
    

            UK parliamentarians were supposed to be given the opportunity to approve or reject the deal in a so-called “meaningful vote” in the House of Commons on Tuesday evening. 
    

            In recent weeks, May had been trying to win support for her agreement but, with a high number of her own Conservative Party MPs opposed to it, she didn’t appear to be having much success. 
    

            There was confusion and anger as May hit the pause button on the vote. 
    

            European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU “will not renegotiate the deal including the backstop” and stressed that “as time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.”
    

            Tusk added that the EU is “ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification.”
    
I have decided to call 
 on 
 (Art. 50) on Thursday. We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification. As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.

            In a post on Twitter before May spoke, EU Parliament chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt expressed his frustration at the vote’s stalling.
    

            “This delay will further aggravate the uncertainty for people & businesses. It’s time they make up their mind!” he wrote.
    
I can’t follow anymore. After two years of negotiations, the Tory government wants to delay the vote. Just keep in mind that we will never let the Irish down. This delay will further aggravate the uncertainty for people & businesses. It’s time they make up their mind! 

            Earlier on Monday, the EU’s top court ruled that 
 the formal process of leaving the bloc next year.
    

            The European Court of Justice sided with the advice of its top legal officer, who declared last week that the UK has the power to withdraw its notification to leave under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, without the agreement of other member states.
    
: UK is free to unilaterally revoke the notification of its intention to withdraw from the EU – Case C-621/18 Wightman 
 

            But May’s government dismissed the ruling, with Environment Secretary Michael Gove telling the BBC that the UK will divorce the bloc regardless of the ECJ decision. 
    

            “We voted very clearly – 17.4 million people sent a clear message that they wanted to leave the European Union,” said Gove, a prominent Leave campaigner. “And that also means leaving the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice,” he said.
    

            Bradley said the agreement secured by the prime minister “is in the best interests of the whole of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland.” 
    

            “The EU wanted to split Great Britain and Northern Ireland into two different customs territories. This agreement ensures that there is one United Kingdom customs territory in which Northern Ireland is an integral part. And the deal means that there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland so that people can continue to lead their lives in the same way as they do today,” Bradley said in her statement.
    

            “Overall, the agreement fully respects the democratically expressed wishes of the people of the United Kingdom who voted by a majority in June 2016 to leave the European Union. It enables us to take back control of our laws, our money and our borders. And in the unlikely event that the future relationship with the EU is not fully agreed by the end of 2020 the UK will have the option of extending the implementation or transition period rather than entering the so-called backstop at all.”

2016-03-16 12:19:00+00:00,,"Evergrande Football School in China is reportedly the world's biggest
Chinese President Xi Jinping hopes it's the future of the country's soccer team
China is ranked 96th in the world despite having world's biggest population

            Rising from the early morning mist like a Disney castle sits the imposing face of what President Xi Jinping hopes is the future of Chinese football.
    

            Evergrande Football School is front and center in the push to bring footballing glory to a nation currently languishing in the lower echelons of the sport.
    

            China’s leader has made no secret of his love for the “beautiful game.” He’s also made it clear he wants to see China qualify for, host and one day win, the World Cup.
    

            And in China, what Xi says, Xi usually gets.
    

            Billions of dollars have been ploughed into the Chinese game in recent years, most notably in the form of high-profile marquee signings in its professional league. 
    

            
 in the space of a month during the close season, as Chinese Super League teams spent more during the winter transfer window than even their English Premier League counterparts.
    

            The likes of Brazilian midfielders Alex Teixeira and Ramires, as well as Colombian striker Jackson Martinez, stole the headlines as they left Europe for China in big-money deals. But there’s much more going on behind the scenes.
    

            In addition to buying players, several of China’s top clubs are pumping money into the grassroots side of the game – specifically youth football.
    

            But it isn’t purely for the love of the game. Experts say it’s all about buying favor with Xi.
    

            “To a Chinese billionaire, a few hundred million dollars is a small price to pay,” China football-watcher Rowan Simons says.
    

            

    

            In just 10 months, and at a cost of $185 million, real estate company Evergrande turned an area of rural southern China into the biggest football school in the world. 
    

            If all goes to plan, the kids learning to trap and pass a ball today could be the ones pulling on a first-team shirt and running out at Guangzhou Evergrande’s Tianhe Stadium in a few years.
    

            Sitting proudly outside the front gates of the school is a 40-foot tall replica FIFA World Cup trophy – a daily reminder of the ultimate goal.
    

            Fourteen-year-old He Xinjie left his family in neighboring Fujian province almost four years ago to chase that dream.
    

            “I hope to make it into the national football team and then make it into the Spanish clubs like Barcelona and Real Madrid,” the slightly-built teen says, with a wry smile. “Or get into the national team and fight for national pride.”
    

            He is one of China’s best players in his age group and is here on a scholarship. 
    

            Without it, he’d still be kicking a ball around the dusty streets of his hometown, he tells us. But he’s one of the fortunate ones and has already been to Spain with the school to play against some of the best Europe has to offer.
    

            “I feel very lucky,” he says, almost embarrassed.
    

            

    

            He’s one of 2,600 boys and 200 girls from across the country – including Tibet, we’re proudly told by our guide – who live and breathe football here.
    

            The reason behind his desire to make it to Spain’s La Liga soon becomes apparent.
    

            Cries of “buen pase” and “gol” echo across the 50 pitches. Two dozen Spanish coaches, the result of a partnership with Real Madrid, bark out instructions – instantly translated into Chinese and repeated with added vehemence.
    

            Unfortunately, for most if not all of the near 3,000 students here, it’s the closest they’ll ever get to playing for the European giants.
    

            After two decades of coaching in Europe, Sergio Zarco Diaz swapped sunny Spain for a challenge in China.
    

            In his four years here, he says the standard has improved dramatically but admits Chinese youngsters have a long way to go.
    

            “What we notice is the children are at a high technical level but the greatest difference is tactically, particularly in the decision making process,” he explains.
    

            China has qualified for just one World Cup – in Japan and South Korea in 2002 – but it didn’t go to plan. Team China went out in the group stage, losing all three matches without scoring a goal.
    

            It’s a problem we saw firsthand. Plenty of huff and puff but not much end product.
    

            Every Saturday morning all 50 pitches are in use as the school’s teams pit themselves against each other, taking a break from the week’s training and putting their skills to the test.
    

            Prowling the touchline are the Spanish coaches, their translators in tow. They’re drowned out only by the shrieks of excited parents who take this weekend opportunity to see their children.
    

            They’re paying up to 60,000 yuan ($9,200) a year to send their children here – slightly more than the average annual wage in China. Unless you’re talented enough to win a scholarship or some form of assistance, you’ve got to be wealthy to come here.
    

            One class in five is football training, the rest of the time taken up with traditional subjects. But football is what everyone really wants to do, so even the non-football classes have a heavy slant towards the game.
    

            “When I first came here I taught using key football terms,” says Zhang Liya, an English teacher from Beijing. “These kids come from all parts of our country and their English level is quite different. They say, ‘When I was young I just learned how to play football, but we never had lessons.’”
    
 Champions ,  
 ! Thanks for all the support ! 

            For Zhang and her colleagues, teaching comes first – even if it might not for their soccer-mad students.
    

            “First we should train the kids to be a good person and how to behave,” she adds. “Then we can train them to be a footballer and maybe eventually they can be a famous football star.”
    

            Traditionally in China team sports have been of low importance, with parents preferring to push their children into prestigious professions like law and medicine. If they did turn to sport, it would be individual events like swimming or gymnastics.
    

            But times are changing. And football is emerging.
    

            The investment here is on a scale you’d only see in China. The 50 pitches are spread over more than 160 acres. They sit alongside basketball, tennis and volleyball courts, a swimming pool and movie theater, as well as a gym, library and several canteens. Special chefs have been flown in from the western Xinjiang province to cater for the dietary requirements of the region’s Muslim players.
    

            Linking it all together are tree-lined avenues, imposing street lamps and grand European-style piazzas.
    

            The manicured lawns and more than $30 million worth of Southeast Asian trees, we’re told, are all just a few hundred yards from barren vegetable patches, wooden shacks and potholed roads. At the heart of the campus is the centerpiece Football Center Building – a huge Hogwarts-style mansion, complete with clock towers and spires.
    

            It’s a stark reminder of China’s wealth divide, and a not-so-subtle reminder of the money the country is throwing at its footballing problem.
    

            China is ranked 96, below minnows like Faroe Islands and Guatemala.
    

            The man who oversees things here at the school, Principal Liu Jiangnan, tells us there’s definitely room for improvement.
    

            “This ranking is incongruous with China’s international standing as a world power,” he says.
    

            “In about four years, Chinese football will definitely see an improvement and maybe return to be one of the top contenders in Asia.
    

            “And of course, in about 20 or 30 years we will set our sights on the top world rankings.”
    

            With the money flowing into Chinese football at the moment, you wouldn’t bet against them.

            Covid-19 has thrown more than a few curve balls at Tokyo Olympic organizers – but this isn’t the first Games to battle a pandemic.
    

            A century ago, the 1920
Antwerp Olympics were held only a few months after the Spanish flu ravaged the world, killing
at least 50 million people. In 2010, the Vancouver Olympics were threatened by an outbreak of H1N1. In 2016, the Zika virus prompted calls to cancel the Rio Games. And most recently in 2018, officials in Pyeongchang wrestled with an outbreak of the norovirus. 
    

            Mass gatherings like the Olympics, that bring together people from all over the world, have always posed a huge infectious disease risk. Visitors bring viruses which may not be endemic to the host country and may
take viral souvenirs home to their own communities. 
    

            “The opportunities for the movement of infectious diseases are accelerated. We’ve seen this across Olympic Games, we’ve seen this in large gatherings like the Hajj or the World Cup,” said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School.
    

            To manage the risk, all Olympic host cities must have a public health plan. 
    

            Preparations begin several years earlier when officials start working with the Olympic Organizing Committee to form pandemic preparedness and epidemic surveillance plans
They start monitoring local infections to set a baseline and track viruses or any irregular infection patterns that could pose a threat.
    

            But few Olympic organizers have had to contend with an outbreak of the size and severity of Covid-19. If nothing else, Tokyo 2020 will enter the record books as the Games that came closest to a
due to rising case numbers.
    

            Here’s how other cities have fared. 

    

            The world was still reeling from the deaths of tens of millions of people from the Spanish flu when some 2,600 athletes gathered in Antwerp to contest the 1920 Summer Olympics.
    

            It was just two years after World War I and Belgium was still suffering food shortages. The country couldn’t afford to build a pool so officials set up a wooden frame in a canal to host the swimming competitions.
    

            Despite the less than desirable conditions, the Games went on without any major problems or outbreaks – they were seen as a symbol of hope and unity in the post-war, post-pandemic world.  
    

            There is always the risk of diseases spreading as people travel, but another concern is the strain an outbreak could put on local health care systems, according to the
 (WHO). 
    

            A community could be prepared to manage an outbreak within its population, but may struggle if that population has ballooned exponentially. In 2012, more than 8 million people attended the London Summer Games, doubling the city’s
population. 
    

            Foreseeing the risks, authorities began public health planning more than seven years ahead of the Games, according to a 
medical journal. Together, they developed a public risk health assessment that would become the foundation of Olympic planning.
    

            The UK already had a strong healthcare monitoring system, but extra surveillance was added for the Games, giving officials daily rather than weekly reports of illnesses and mortality across the country.
    

            The report said officials had realized the urgency of reassuring the public at such a large event. Workers monitored social media to quickly counter rumors of illness with facts. 
    

            Public health surveillance methods were improved based on this analysis and would go on to become a legacy of London 2012. Similar risk analysis methods were also used in the planning of Rio 2016. 
    

            Ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics, talk was dominated by the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne disease primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected female Aedes aegypti mosquito. 
    

            Symptoms include fever, rash and joint pain, though a Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly, a neurological disorder that results in babies being born with abnormally small heads. 
    

            Several high level athletes, such as pro golfer 
, dropped out of the competition due to concerns about the illness.
    

            Before the Games, Brownstein’s team created a map to model the potential transmission of the Zika virus from the Olympics – Brazil was a hotspot and had declared a 
 in 2015.
    

            “We do mining of all these articles and social media posts looking for clues about disease events and different populations across many different languages,” Brownstein said. “We use machine learning and AI to go through all that data, filter it, tag it, and then make it available to like WHO and CDC and others.”
    

            Researchers mapped areas highly susceptible to the virus, such as parts of Asia and Africa that have dengue outbreaks, countries sending the most athletes, as well as countries with the most travelers from Brazil. 
    

            Though the WHO said there were no confirmed cases of Zika among Olympics athletes or travelers, maps like this can help predict and prevent viral transmission ahead of mass gatherings. Though there were no confirmed cases of Zika at Rio, that doesn’t mean there were no infections at all since most people don’t show symptoms. 
    

            While Zika did not have an impact on the Olympics, it continued to torment poorer local communities for months to come. 
 argued the seasonal patterns of diseases similar to Zika predicted Zika’s decline ahead of the Games and the diversion of scarce resources to a relatively low-risk population – wealthy tourists and athletes – instead of those who were in dire need of them, could have been avoided. 
    

            In June 2009, seven months before the start of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Games, the WHO declared H1N1 – also known as swine flu – a pandemic. 
    

            There were more than 33,000 cases of H1N1 and 428 deaths in Canada during the 2009-2010 flu season, according to Infection Prevention and Control Canada. 
    

            “It seems so long ago now, but I remember in the fall of 2009 there were high level discussions about the impact this might have on the Games, and it doesn’t seem real now, but at the time, it was very real,” said Rob Stewart, Medical Services Operations Manager of Vancouver 2010. 
    

            Though the pandemic had largely subsided by the start of the Games, officials were still on high alert. 
    

            Public health was considered in every part of the planning process from venue design, setting up hand washing facilities and proper sanitation, to public messaging on cough etiquette and social distancing. Spectators and athletes who weren’t able to get vaccinated at home were given free H1N1 jabs on site. 
    

            “Every day we could communicate with public health at about 11 o’clock at night and we’d get the stats for the day and then we would go over them,” said Dr. Mike Wilkinson, Director of Medical Services at Vancouver 2010. 
    

            Daily briefing documents included everything from immunization levels to air quality to any infectious disease outbreaks in the region. 
    

            “Influenza activity throughout the region remains well below historical norms. Other respiratory viruses predominate. Drinking water quality data supports tap water as the best choice for visitors and residents,” reads a Health Watch report from February 2, 2010, 10 days before the start of the Games.
    

            Ultimately no athletes caught H1N1 at the Vancouver Games. “It’s always said of the Games, if I’m the chief medical officer and I’m the one looking around as if I’m not doing anything that means that I’ve done a good job,” said Wilkinson.
    

            Similar precautions were taken in the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics, where officials battled a norovirus outbreak. 
    

            Just days before the opening ceremony, norovirus – an extremely contagious stomach bug – spread among security staff at an Olympic accommodation facility, infecting 41 guards. 
    

            A total of 1,200 security guards were put in 
 to limit the spread while testing was conducted. “That’s the trick, to catch it early enough,” said Stewart, from Vancouver 2010.
“Isolate the people that are sick and they stay there. By the time you’re looking at a whole team, you’re probably quite far down the road. The trick is to catch it right away.” 
    

            The quarantined staff were quickly replaced with 900 military personnel from South Korea’s conscripted army, who had been on standby with extra manpower as part of the contingency plans. 
    

            “That is the key of this success, communication among different interest groups is the essential part of the success of the prevention of epidemic outbreak,” said Dr. Young-Hee Lee, Chief Medical Officer of Pyeongchang 2018. 
    

            Ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, medical officers from previous Games have been sharing their experiences and advice with the current organizing committee, though they admit it’s a completely different ball game this time around. 
    

            “Everything pales in comparison to what they are having to do now in Tokyo,” said Wilkinson, but he said virus surveillance and containment methods remain largely the same. 
    

            “We know what works, what historically has worked,” he said – personal hygiene, social distancing, masking, cough etiquette and vaccinations are the foundation of that. 
    

            Stewart added: “You plan for the worst and hope for the best.”

Cameron: ""Let no one in Scotland be in any doubt: we desperately want you to stay""
Energy giant BP urges Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom
Palace: The Queen ""is above politics"" and doesn't want to influence outcome of vote

            UK Prime Minister David Cameron is campaigning in Scotland Wednesday in a last-minute bid to persuade voters to stick with the United Kingdom ahead of 
 in eight days.
    

            Also north of the border are Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, partners with Cameron’s Conservatives in the coalition government, and opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband.
    

            The trip comes as the latest opinion polls indicated that the pro-independence and pro-union campaigns are neck-and-neck.
    

            If Scotland’s voters choose independence on September 18, it will mean the breakup of a 307-year-old union between England, Wales and Scotland as Great Britain.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            Cameron and Miliband canceled their usual weekly clash at Prime Minister’s Questions in Parliament to make the trip. They are campaigning separately as they seek to win over the undecided voters who will be key to the outcome of the landmark vote.
    

            The Prime Minister appealed to the emotions in a speech to an audience in Edinburgh, saying, “I care hugely about this extraordinary country, this United Kingdom, that we have built together.”
    

            He would be heartbroken, he said, “if this family of nations was torn apart.”
    

            

    

            Opinion polls suggest the pro-independence “yes” campaign, led by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond of the governing Scottish National Party, 
 as the vote nears.
    

            Speaking to supporters Wednesday, Salmond said the politicians’ visit from London was “counterproductive” for the “no” campaign and would be seen by Scotland as “a last gasp piece of desperation from the Westminster establishment.”
    

            He added, “I mean they’re not popular in England, never mind popular in Scotland.”
    

            The latest poll of polls on Scottish independence shows the “no” camp hanging on to a narrow lead over the “yes” camp, but the gap continues to close. The poll of polls, by ScotCen, an independent research center, shows “no” at 52% and “yes” at 48%.
    

            Almost anyone living in Scotland age 16 or over on the day of the referendum will be able to vote. But voters in the rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales and Northern Ireland – do not get a say on what could be a historic change. That includes Scots who live outside Scotland’s borders.
    

            

    

            Cameron also used emotive language in an opinion piece 
 Wednesday in which he recalled the United Kingdom’s historic achievements – and promised that more are to come if it sticks together.
    

            “Let no one in Scotland be in any doubt: we desperately want you to stay; we do not want this family of nations to be ripped apart,” he wrote. 
    

            “Across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, our fear over what we stand to lose is matched only by our passion for what can be achieved if we stay together.”
    

            The three parties have all promised that Scotland, which already has devolved government, would be granted increased powers, for example over taxation and social welfare programs, if it votes to stay in the United Kingdom.
    

            “There is a lot that divides us – but there’s one thing on which we agree passionately: the United Kingdom is better together,” the three party leaders said in a joint statement Tuesday.
    

            “We want to be listening and talking to voters about the huge choices they face. Our message to the Scottish people will be simple: ‘We want you to stay.’ “
    

            

    

            A YouGov poll carried out Monday suggests that people in England and Wales are opposed to Scottish independence by a substantial majority, with 60% opposed to 19% in favor.
    

            Former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, writing Wednesday in the Times of London, warned that if Scotland votes for independence, it and all the United Kingdom would suffer as a result.
    

            “The UK would be weaker in every international body and, most damagingly, within the European Union,” he wrote. “Our chance of reforming the EU would be diminished, and the risk of our exit from it enhanced.”
    

            Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on UK membership of the European Union by the end of 2017 if he remains Prime Minister after the general election next year.
    

            Campaigners for Scottish independence
have said they want to remain part of the European Union. EU leaders have indicated that an independent Scotland would have to apply to join like any other nation.
    

            

    

            The independence issue has polarized Scotland, with much argument over the potential economic costs or benefits, particularly with regard to the North Sea oil and gas found in Scottish waters. 
    

            The Scottish government says it would manage the energy reserves better than the UK government, benefiting the Scottish people. But some experts have warned against over-reliance on a finite resource.
    

            Energy giant 
 and voiced caution over North Sea prospects it described as “smaller and more challenging to develop” than before. 
    

            “Our business invests for decades into the future. It is important our plans are based on a realistic view of the North Sea’s future potential and the challenges the industry faces in continuing to operate here,” it said.
    

            “As a major investor in Scotland – now and into the future – BP believes that the future prospects for the North Sea are best served by maintaining the existing capacity and integrity of the United Kingdom.”
    

            

    

            Buckingham Palace has made clear that Queen Elizabeth II will not take a position on the Scottish referendum amid UK media reports that lawmakers are urging her to intervene on behalf of the union.
    

            “The Sovereign’s constitutional impartiality is an established principle of our democracy and one which the Queen has demonstrated throughout her reign,” a palace statement said. 
    

            “As such, the Queen is above politics, and those in political office have a duty to ensure that this remains the case.
    

            “Any suggestion that the Queen should wish to influence the outcome of the current referendum campaign is categorically wrong. This is a matter for the people of Scotland.”
    

            The queen would remain head of state of an independent Scotland.

Former Newell's Old Boys boss signs two-year deal at Nou Camp
Fourth Argentine manager in Barca's history
Says Cesc Fabregas is staying despite bid from Manchester United.

            Gerardo Martino was unveiled as Barcelona’s new manager Friday – promising not to change their attacking style of play but introducing “new ideas” to help the Catalan giants dominate European club football.
    

            The 50-year-old Martino has replaced Tito Vilanova, who stood down last week to undergo further treatment for throat cancer.
    

            Martino, who took Newell’s Old Boys to the Argentine Clausura Championship, has signed a two-year deal at the Nou Camp.
    

            

    

            He will take charge of a side which romped to the La Liga title last season with a record points tally, but suffered a crushing humiliation in the semifinals of the Champions League, going down 7-0 on aggregate to eventual winners Bayern Munich.
    

      
      

      

    

      
      

      

    

            It led to suggestions that Barcelona needed to make tactical changes, having gone out at the same stage of the competition for the past two years, but Martino believes it will not need a major revamp.
    

            “Every team, even Barcelona which has already attained certain moments of excellence, can always improve, and Barca still has things to win,” he told gathered reporters.
    

            

    

            “We are going to try to recover certain things that we’ve seen when Barca  have been at their best, and add a few ideas of our own.”
    

            Martino confirmed that Barca’s talisman and fellow Argentinian Lionel Messi would continue to operate in his current role.
    

            “He will continue to play in exactly the same position. He has to feel comfortable,  after that he’ll do the rest.”
    

            Messi will be joined by big-name Brazilian signing Neymar for the new campaign, while Martino appeared to rule out the departure of midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who is the subject of a bid from English Premier League champions Manchester United.
    

            Asked about United’s attempts to sign the Spanish international with a $38 million bid on the table, Martino gave a firm reply.
    

            

    

            “If the club has signaled its refusal twice, then I signal it a third time - and  so he (Fabregas) will be staying here,”
    

            Club vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who flanked Martino with president Sandro Rosell, also chipped in.
    

            “We are not thinking of selling Cesc,” he said. “That United are showing interest in Cesc is normal, because he’s a great  player.
    

            “That doesn’t upset us, that makes us proud that they want one of our players.
    

            “But whatever the offer, we won’t be selling him. We are relying on him.”
    

            

    

            Martino’s appointment Tuesday came as a surprise as he has no managerial experience in Europe.
    

            But his pedigree is clear, winning four championship titles in Paraguay, before guiding their national team to the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup.
    

            He has also been a success at Newell’s, a former club of Messi. 
    

            Martino is the fourth Argentine to take the helm at Barcelona after Roque Olsen, Helenio Herrera and Cesar Luis Menotti.

            As retiring in style goes, this will take some beating.
    

            In reportedly his final race before making a permanent move to a stud, Maurice – ridden by jockey Ryan Moore – romped to victory in the Longines Hong Kong Cup to claim its $3.22 million prize.
    

            Despite getting out of the starting blocks slowly, Moore bided his time and calmly weaved his way through the field as Maurice added the Cup to last year’s win in the Hong Kong Mile.
    

            “Fortunately there was good pace in the race and halfway down the back I thought it was setting up nicely for him and it was just a matter of finding the room,” Moore told reporters after the race.
    
Maurice is Hong Kong perfection. Winner of HK Mile last year, Champions Mile in May, he dominated the 2016 G1 
 Hong Kong Cup 
 

            “As soon as he got room and I put him into gear he just let down exceptionally well. He finished off easily and he got to the leader early and then he was just easing up really. 
    

            

    

            “He has improved every time I’ve ridden him.”
    

            Moore was full of praise for the five-year-old Maurice, who made it a successful day for trainer Noriyuki Hori after Satono Crown won the Hong Kong Vase earlier Sunday.
    

            “He’s a brilliant horse. He is very good at a mile but he is possibly better at 10 furlongs. He has improved, he is a big strong horse and he has got better with racing. He has been a pleasure to ride.”
    

            

    
Astonishing day of racing at the 2016 
. Attendance 100,710, a record, turnover of HK$1.518 billion, also an event record. 

            “I’ve had a lot of fun riding Maurice. I’m always OK when I’m on him, although today when the gates opened, he made it a bit more difficult for me.”
    

            Moore had to wait until late in the race before finally overtaking eventual runner up Secret Weapon and  Hori, who became the first foreign-based trainer to record a Hong Kong double, was coy when asked if this was Maurice’s last race.

            There is little respite in victory for Ukrainian forces in the recently liberated 
. Russian shells still hit its pockmarked streets, marring the skyline with plumes of black smoke.
    

            Intense damage is visible on nearly every building. A huge billboard with an image of a waving Russian flag stands next to the bridge that crosses the Oskil River in the city center, bearing the words, “We are one people with Russia!”
    

            For now, the 
has chased Russian forces over the bridge and appears to be building some momentum pushing across the eastern banks of the river towards Luhansk, a key separatist territory controlled by Moscow. CNN witnessed Ukrainian infantry returning from the eastern side on foot. 
    

            Yet inside this city, one of several in the eastern region of Kharkiv that have been liberated, are the telltale signs of a hellish occupation. A former police building was used as a vast detention center by the Russians, where at one point up to 400 prisoners were held in its cramped and dark cells, with eight or nine prisoners per room, Ukrainian authorities told CNN. A brightly painted mural of a Russian soldier with a “Z” on his armband standing next to an elderly woman waving the flag of the former Soviet empire is still visible on one wall. 
    

            Before CNN was allowed to enter, a prisoner with his hands bound in glossy blue tape was quickly led outside, placed in a vehicle and driven away.
    

            This one was possibly a Russian soldier, according to the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU), who think he either deserted his troops or was left behind. The prisoner claimed to be a local, the SBU said. 
    

            Just outside of the building’s entrance, two Russian flags tied to wooden poles were strewn on the floor, one with signs of being burned. Inside, rubbish littered the floors of the damp space. Through the narrow hallway were small rooms on each side, where Russians used to keep their prisoners.
    

            A few small mattresses and tables were seen in some of the small cells, others held just a table and two chairs, remnants of what could have been an interrogation room.
    

            Not all the rooms had been cleared of possible explosives, officials told CNN. A grenade booby trap sat on a bench inside a cell, held in place by a half-eaten food tin.
    

            As CNN walked through the center, an SBU officer noticed the trap and wrote “Grenade!!!” on the wall outside the cell with a black marker and an arrow to show exactly which room investigators should enter. The door was closed. 
    

            As the investigations continue, Ukrainian officials are discovering other scars too, like those from alleged torture. 
    

            A former prisoner who was introduced to CNN by the Ukrainian Security Services said he was imprisoned in the building about a month ago. Walking through the corridor, he showed CNN the room where he said the Russians interrogated him.
    

            “They put me on this chair,” the former prisoner – who CNN has not named for his safety – said, pointing. “There the investigator sat, and there was the guy with the telephone and another one who helped.”
    

            The telephone was an old wind-up model that he said was used to send electric shocks into him. He thinks his interrogator was experienced in this method from their time in the Russian Security Services, the FSB. 
    

            The occupiers asked him who he was in touch with from the Ukrainian army, and told them he was once a cook in the army, he said.
    

            “They told me, ‘You think you are tough. Let’s find out how tough,’” he said. “They also shot me with some kind of pistol. Here and in the leg,” he told CNN, pointing to his chest and leg.
    

            “They promised I’d only see the sun and sky again if they forced me into a minefield,” he said. “The main thing is to survive and to withstand. It took me a week and a half to recover when I got out.”
    

            The man is not the only one dealing with the scars from a brutal invasion, detention and alleged torture.  
    

            As authorities continue investigating and clearing liberated towns in the Kharkiv region, they’re finding more and more evidence of detention centers and cells used for torture.
    

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday that “more than 10 torture rooms” used by occupying forces have so far been found in the area. “As the occupiers fled, they also dropped the torture devices,” he said. 
    

            CNN has reached out to the Russian government for comment but has not received a response.
    

            Kupiansk might be recently liberated but the city is a ghost town, punctuated by destruction and debris.

Almost 60% of Italians voted against Renzi's constitutional reforms

            Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi officially resigned Wednesday after a crushing defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform.
    

            Sunday, Italians voted decisively against changes to the constitution put forward by Renzi, a vote that became a poll on the prime minister’s leadership.
    

            Renzi addressed his center-left Democratic Party Wednesday evening, giving a speech on his short term as prime minister that marked his government’s achievements.
    

            “I’m leaving this country with less taxes to pay and more rights, and our party should be proud of that,” he said. 
    

            One of Renzi’s hallmark pieces of legislation was the legal recognition of same-sex unions.
    

            “When I resigned, I know that some people in this party celebrated enthusiastically and not very elegantly. But I won’t blame them because when you are the prime minister of the most beautiful country in the world, you have no right to sulk.”
    

            Renzi then met with President Sergio Mattarella to officially step down.
    

            Mattarella asked Renzi to carry on in a caretaker capacity while he consults with the political parties about next steps, the President’s office said in a statement.
    

            The 41-year-old Renzi, who was appointed to office in 2014, said Monday that he would resign and arranged to meet with the President after close to 60% of voters rejected his proposals.
    

            But Mattarella asked Renzi to delay his resignation until Parliament passed a law on the state budget, which it did Wednesday.
    

            Renzi’s intention was to change the 1948 constitution by reducing the power of Parliament’s upper house, the Senato, through a reduction in members – cutting it from  315 to 100, making it more of a consultative assembly.
    

            Supporters of the referendum said the goal was to make the job of governing Italy less complicated and to be able to pass legislation more easily to help revive the nation’s lethargic economy.
    

      
      

      

    

            But critics said it would transfer too much power to Renzi’s party.
    

            The outcome, with a 70% turnout, was considered a notable victory for euroskeptic populist and nationalist parties, which campaigned heavily against Renzi and his promise to stimulate the economy.
    

            The “no” campaign was spearheaded by the anti-establishment Five Star Movement party, led by Beppe Grillo, which is expected to make substantial gains if a general election is called.
    

            Grillo – an entertainer-turned-politican known for his unruly language and mop of silver hair – made a name for himself on Italian TV in the 1970s and 1980s. He capitalized on his show-business bravado to promote an anti-establishment movement spanning both the left and right of politics.
    

      
      

      

    

            Foreign observers fear that if Grillo comes to power in an early election, he’ll call a referendum to scrap the euro, go back to the Italian lira, and perhaps even follow Britain out of the European Union.
    

            But Renzi was also accused of running a populist campaign, touting the reforms as a way to have “less politicians.” Renzi said in an interview before that vote that a “yes” vote was the true “anti-establishment choice.”
    

            In a tweet before meeting with his party, Renzi posted a note on his office letterhead reading: “Bye all!!! And thank you.”
    
La enews di oggi
 

            Speculation has begun to swirl in Italian media on who will take Renzi’s place.
    

            Economy and Finances Minister Pier Carlo Padoan and senate speaker and former Mafia magistrate Pietro Grasso are both tipped as favorites.
    

            Mattarella could ask Renzi to remain as a caretaker prime minister, or he could name another interim leader, who would need to be approved by Parliament. 
    

            Alternatively, Italy could call a snap election if the President and Parliament are unable to form a caretaker government. Italy is not scheduled to hold legislative elections until 2018.

            “Our prayers are with all his family and friends. He ‘fought the good fight’ and now he rests,” it added.
    

            McMillan won the 2017 Arnold Classic bodybuilding competition, and the organizer, the Arnold Sports Festival, said it was “heartbroken” in a tribute on Instagram.
    

            “Known for his larger than life personality, his infectious smile, a gentle heart, and a sense of humor that was loved by fellow competitors and fans alike, Cedric will be deeply missed,” the

            A former Chechen commander wanted by Ukraine for alleged 
 committed last year is leading the Russian earthquake relief effort in 
.
    

            Daniil Martynov was in several locations in Ukraine last year in the early weeks of the Russian invasion. He is thought to be close to the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and has been featured in several videos on Kadyrov’s official Telegram channel.
    

            In recent days, he has given 
 to Russian media outlets from the earthquake zone in Turkey, after being appointed last year as an adviser in Russia’s Emergency Situations Ministry. 
    

            Authorities have been racing against the clock to 
 from the wreckage of a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that struck early on Monday morning, causing buildings to collapse and killing thousands in Turkey and Syria. Dozens of countries have 
 to help with rescue efforts.
    

            Last August, the Ukrainian security service, the SBU, 
 that Martynov had committed a series of war crimes in the town of Borodianka, north of Kyiv.
    

            The SBU described Martynov as the Deputy Head of the National Guard Troops in the Chechen Republic and said he was “responsible for the training of Kadyrov’s personal security detail.”
    

            The SBU alleged that Martinov managed the 
 in March. It said that on his orders “almost 500 people were taken hostage (patients, staff and local residents), including more than a hundred bed-ridden patients.”
    

            The SBU alleged that the hospital had been “turned into a firing position of the occupiers” and said that Martynov was accused of “violation of the laws and customs of war, and abuse of prisoners of war or civilians.”
    

            CNN 
 on the occupation of the hospital last March.
    

      
      

      

    

            The director of the psychiatric hospital, Maryna Hanitska, told the independent Russian outlet Meduza last year that the Russians had “laid mines all around us. We watched as they dug trenches” in the first week of March. 
    

            Meduza quotes Hanitska as saying: “A soldier stood in front of me and he introduced himself. He said he was Daniil Martynov, a Russian army colonel. He said that if we behaved ourselves, then we would live — they wouldn’t kill us, wouldn’t hurt us.”
    

            Hanitska told Meduza that Martynov told her: “Now we’ll record a short video, you’ll thank us and you’ll be free, you’ll be under the protection of Russian President Vladimir Putin.”
    

            “I asked, what’s there to be thankful for? He leaned in close to my face, looked me in the eyes, and said: “For the fact that you’re alive.”
    

            CNN cannot independently confirm that it was Martynov who spoke to the hospital director.
    

            There is no record of Martynov responding to the Ukrainian allegations. While dismissing the SBU accusations last August, Kadyrov said: “With regard to Martynov, he does not work for us. He’s working with the MES [Ministry of Emergency Situations.]” 
    

            In a 
, Kadyrov said: “OK, SBU, just tell us the time and place and we will come sort out just who the real criminals are.”
    

            Martynov was sanctioned in 2020 by the US Treasury Department for “serious human rights abuse in Russia.” It said he was “a personal security adviser for Kadyrov, [and] has acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, Kadyrov.”
    

            Several videos posted on Kadyrov’s official Telegram channel last year show Martynov at various locations in occupied parts of Ukraine.
    

            In one he is 
 as a member of Chechen special forces in Ukraine.
    

            Among the locations where he was 
 was the town of Popasna in Luhansk region, which was razed to the ground by Russian shelling.

Talisman Drogba addressed the nation and helped bring peace to a country at war

            Sinking to their knees, arms draped over each other’s shoulders, footballers for Ivory Coast’s national team began to plead with their fans and fellow Ivorians.
    

            The players had just made history, securing Ivory Coast’s place at the 2006 World Cup, their first ever appearance at the global tournament with a 3-1 victory away over Sudan.
    

            Though the scene in the changing room was one of jubilation, the players had more pressing concerns on their minds.
    

            At the time of the match, the Ivory Coast was embroiled in a bloody civil war which would kill an estimated 4,000 people and displaced over 1 million.
    

            The national team captain, Cyril Domoraud, invited the media into the changing room and handed the microphone to Didier Drogba, star striker and national icon.
    

            “Men and women of the Ivory Coast,” he said down the lens, his face stern and sincere. “From the north, south, center and west, we proved today that all Ivorians can coexist and play together with a shared objective: to qualify for the World Cup.
    

            “We promised you that the celebration would unite the people. Today, we beg you, please – on our knees – forgive. Forgive, forgive.
    

            “The one country in Africa with so many riches must not descend into war like this. Please, lay down all weapons. Hold elections, organize elections. All will be better.”
    

            Rising to their feet, broad smiles now spread across their faces, the players started to sing.
    

            “We want to have fun, so stop firing your guns,” they chorused tunefully.
    

            

    

            

    

            

    

            

    

            Breaking out in 2002, Ivory Coast’s first Civil War centered around national identity and ‘Ivoirité’ – what did it mean to be truly Ivorian?
    

            People were denied official nationality if they could not provide documentation that both their parents were born in the Ivory Coast.
    

            By the time Drogba addressed the nation from the Al-Merrikh Stadium in October 2005, the civil war had been raging for three years.
    

            Drogba’s speech and the team’s qualification for the World Cup helped convince the government and opposing New Forces to hold a ceasefire and restart peace talks.
    

            In early 2007, the two warring sides signed an official peace agreement, causing then president Laurent Gbagbo to declare the war was over.
    

            The road to continued peace, however, has been a bumpy one. The elections – which were initially supposed to take place in 2005 – weren’t held until 2010, the results were disputed and war soon broke out again.
    

            Though Drogba will be remembered mostly for his exploits on the pitch, his efforts to help try and bring to an end a civil war won’t be forgotten.
    

            “Seeing both leaders side by side for the national anthems was very special,” he told the Telegraph in 2007, a few months after the peace agreement.
    

            “I felt then that the Ivory Coast was born again.”
    

            On Saturday, the country’s national team missed out on a place in next year’s World Cup in Russia after falling to a 2-0 home defeat by Morocco.

            Russia launched a 
 of missiles toward 
 on Monday as it accused Kyiv of striking military airfields deep inside its territory.
    

            Dozens of missiles were launched by Russian forces towards Ukraine on Monday, cutting off water and electricity supplies in some areas, and killing at least one person in the Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, and at least two people in Zaporizhzhia, according to local authorities. 
    

            Debris from one missile also crossed the Ukrainian border, hitting a town in Moldova. 
    

            The Ukrainian Air Force said that more than 60 Russian missiles were intercepted. Yet some reached their targets and the shelling cut water and electricity access in Kryvyi Rih and in the southern city of Odesa, after recent shortages across the country due to Russian attacks targeting 
.
    

            The Russian Defense Ministry said that Ukraine used drones to attack two Russian military airfields on Monday morning, adding that its air defenses intercepted the attacks “in the Saratov and Ryazan regions,” according to a statement carried on the official Russian news agency RIA Novosti. 
    

            “On the morning of December 5, the (Kyiv) regime, in order to disable Russian long-range aircraft, attempted to strike with Soviet-made jet unmanned aerial vehicles [drones] at the Diaghilevo military airfields in the Ryazan region and Engels in the Saratov region,” it said in the statement. 
    

            “The air defense of the Russian Aerospace Forces intercepted these Ukrainian drones flying at low altitude,” it said, adding the the destroyed drones “slightly damaged” two aircraft.
    

            Three people were killed and six injured after a fuel truck exploded at the Russian airfield near the city of Ryazan, Russian state media reported. The explosion occurred at an aircraft parking lot at the airfield, emergency services told state news agency TASS on Monday.
    

            The aftermath of the explosion at the airfield appears to have been captured by Israeli satellite imagery company ImageSat International (ISI), which showed “burn marks and objects” near “a Tu-22M aircraft that was probably damaged,” it told CNN. 
    

            The second drone flew to the western Russian city of Engels, where an airbase with the same name is located. 
    

            CCTV footage geolocated by CNN appears to show an explosion lighting up the sky at around 6 a.m. local time on Monday morning in Engels, which is around 500 miles southeast of Moscow. The footage, which was shared on social media, was recorded approximately 3.7 miles away from where the Engels-2 airfield is located, a strategic bomber airbase.
    

            Saratov region Governor Roman Busargin, reassured residents on Telegram that no civilian infrastructure was damaged but said “information about incidents at military facilities is being checked by law enforcement agencies.”
    

            He acknowledged information about “about a loud bang and a burst in Engels in the early morning” was spreading on social networks and the media.
    

            Pro-Russian bloggers have said that the incidents were likely an act of sabotage from Ukraine, which has not confirmed that it attacked either airfield. 
    

            The Ukrainian Air Force said on Telegram that 70 missiles were launched on Monday by Russia. While it said that a “massive attack on critical infrastructure” had been repelled, with the bulk of missiles intercepted, some caused considerable damage. 
    

            The port city of Odesa appearing to be among the worst affected regions. Water supply company Infoksvodokanal said that in Odesa, “all pumping station and reserve lines are without power – thus consumers don’t have water.”
    

            “Part of the city is without electricity, some boiler houses and pumping stations are off,” said Oleksandr Vilkul, a military official in Kryvyi Rih.
    

            In the capital, Kyiv, about 40% of people in the capital are without power supply after an energy facility was hit on Monday, according to military official Oleksii Kuleba.
    

            Power cuts were also reported in the western Ukrainian region of Prykarpattia, as a result of Moscow’s shelling campaign.
    

            State energy company, Ukrenergo, had reduced electricity capacity in the Prykarpattia area by one third, Svitlana Onyshchuk, a regional official, said. 
    

            The head of a major energy distributor said the overall situation was difficult but under control. “Almost all regions of Ukraine are subject to emergency blackouts. Power engineers have started to repair the damage, the work will continue overnight. We will try to return to the scheduled outages as soon as possible to stop emergency outages,” Dmytro Sakharuk, CEO of DTEK, said on Telegram. 
    

            “The most complicated situation is in Kyiv region, Kyiv city, Odesa city and northern regions of the country. This is due to both the damage and the number of consumers,” he added. 
    

            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked “air defense forces, our power engineers and our people” in a statement on Monday, adding that power engineers have already started to restore electricity.
    

            He later added that repair work was continuing “in the central regions of Ukraine, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv.”
    

            “In order to stabilize the power grid, it was necessary to switch to emergency shutdowns in many regions,” he said.
    

            There has been much speculation about the Russian stockpile of missiles – with the last such wave of missile strikes on Ukraine happening on November 23. 
    

            In the wake of Monday’s attacks on Ukraine, the country’s Defense Intelligence (DI) said Moscow still has enough missiles to inflict heavy damage on Ukrainian infrastructure – despite stocks potentially falling to “critical levels.”
    

            The shelling during the day was “another terrorist attack on peaceful, civilian infrastructure, primarily energy infrastructure,” according to DI spokesperson Andrii Yusov.
    

            “Regarding high-precision weapons in Russia, by many indicators the stockpiles of missiles have fallen to critical levels,” Yusov said on Ukrainian television on Monday.
    

            Further south, and away from the front lines, a missile was identified in a town called Briceni 
, about three kilometers (almost two miles) from the Ukrainian border. 
    

            It is not immediately clear from the images what type the rocket is. CNN is working on confirming the type of missile.
    

            The Moldovan Interior Ministry added in their statement “the area where the rocket was discovered has been isolated by police patrol and border police. The specialized services of the interior ministry” are on the scene.
    

            Residents in Moldova 
 after the Kremlin targeted critical infrastructure in November. At the time, Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister and Infrastructure Minister Andrei Spinu warned the risks of power cuts remain high in the face of Russia’s grueling invasion of Ukraine.

            It’s a classic family scene. The proud parents showing off their new baby in the garden. A doting grandpa snapping photographs.
    

            Fine for Facebook or Instagram. But when the baby in question is the future British king, and the photos are the 
, it doesn’t take long for the world to weigh in – on their quality, no less.
    

            Most seem to agree that Michael Middleton, father of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and granddad to 
 should leave royal photography to the professionals.
    

            “They are lovely snaps for a grandfather to have taken. But in terms of the quality, they are not really what you want for such a historic picture” 
, vice chairman of the British Press Photographers Association and a photographer for the Daily Telegraph.

to use “one of proud grandpa Mike’s happy family snaps” as “a startling break with tradition.” 
    

            Most criticism zeroed in on the focus and the lighting – always a challenge for amateur photographers not equipped with fancy flashes or reflectors.
    

            
 and Catherine, the latter holding Prince George swaddled in a white blanket, are posed on the lawn of her parents’ home in Berkshire with the sun behind them, a difficult shot to pull off.
    

            “I guess the reason Kate’s father chose backlight was to avoid bright sun on little George,” speculates the Mirror’s royal photographer, Kent Gavin.
    

            He’s happy to share some advice though. “Back-lighting is always a little tricky for the non-professionals but it does give a nice result. Photographing against the sun needs a fill-in flash.  Another option would be to use an area in shade away from harsh light.”
    

            His other tip? “My professional view would be to see more of baby George.”
    

            

    

            The inclusion of the family pets – the Cambridges’ cocker spaniel Lupo and the Middletons’ golden retriever Tilly – in some of the snaps also gets a mixed reception.
    

            A reporter for The Times of London remarked that the official photographs came “in a choice of formats: with or without dogs.”
    

            Mulholland, of the Telegraph, was more scathing. “The photograph with the dogs is the worst. One of the dogs in the corner looks like a furry rug,” he wrote.
    

            But the pictures got a more favorable write-up from some CNN readers 
.
    

            “Babies, happy parents and dogs all bring smiles and the world needs more smiles!” said Earlypro.
    

            “Its nice to see a family snap and not a professional one. Its a special time with a new baby I hope the press backs off and let them enjoy it,” wrote Ann.
    

            The public also weighed in on Twitter.
    

            “Who cares? The photos are beautiful and show a new family! I think it’s great that ‘Grandad’ got to take the photos,” 
, a mother of two from the English West Midlands.
    

            “I’m no royal watcher, but love choice new family made to release photos snapped by baby George grampa. Can u blame them?” posted 
, a portrait studio in Dublin, Ireland.
    

            

    

            However, John Keatley, an editorial and celebrity photographer in Seattle, told CNN that taking such informal pictures jars the royal “brand.”
    

            “The amateur image that these photos put across certainly doesn’t create the most grand or royal image in the viewer’s mind,” he said.
    

            “They’re decent photos. They’re not terrible. But at the same time, they certainly don’t have the same shine and pop and feeling of grandeur that you often see from official royal family photos.”
    

            He acknowledged that the family may have been trying to project a casual, informal image.
    

            But, he added, “You can still make it casual. But this is just casual and poor quality. They didn’t have to make a bad quality product to put that idea across.”
    

            Christopher Barr, a professional photographer in Arizona, agrees.
    

            “It’s obvious that a professional didn’t take these. It hasn’t been color-corrected. Even somebody with a modicum of Photoshop knowledge could improve these pictures immeasurably,” he said.
    

            “It’s not a very good effort. It’s a particularly poor effort given that he’s taking pictures of such an important thing at such an important time.”
    

            But Lana Marks, a friend of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, told CNN’s “AC360” show that she thinks William’s mother would have been delighted by his approach.
    

            “One of the things she told me is that she so much wanted William to have a normal life with his family in the future, with whoever he wed and had children with,” she said.
    

            “All of her dreams have come true and her legacy’s coming true, and all the influences she’s had on William, the normalcy, is showing through so greatly now. She would be immensely happy.”
